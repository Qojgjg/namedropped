Stuck in trying to seem perfect. Stuck in sadness. Stuck feeling numb. Stuck pursuing more stuff to make us happy. Stuck in something we can't even name. These stuck places often go unattended inside of us and they are shaping our lives more than we would like to think. \n\nWe've been trying to fix this feeling with everything but... God. He has a plan for these spaces inside of us, the places we feel broken, but we have to go to Him. \n\nSeason 2 of the Made for This Podcast is here! And we’re going to get UNSTUCK. Let’s talk about anger, discontentment, overwhelm, fear and sadness…. some of the places we all get stuck. There will be interviews and Scripture every week. Come on this journey with us to take an honest look at the fight going on inside that leads us to the God who can set us free!",

This happens primarily through efforts in publishing and broadcasting biblical truth.Love Worth Finding began in 1987, as a response to several requests for tapes of messages by pastor and Bible teacher Adrian Rogers. He relates that \"soon the requests began to grow to the point that we knew God was leading us into a wider ministry.\" As an extension of Dr. Rogers' pulpit ministry Love Worth Finding provided that role and continues today.Dr. Rogers stated, \"I believe God wants us to proclaim the message of salvation in the power of the Holy Spirit by every means possible. Thats our commitment at Love Worth Finding.\"In response to many who are asking,has that purpose changed since the home-going of Dr. Rogers? No, God wants us to continue to proclaim the message of salvation. The messenger may be gone, but the message must continue. Millions still have not heard the precious name of Jesus or know His redeeming grace.So our race is not over. We must still rununtil Jesus comes. If you believe in what God has called LWF to do,we invite you to help us proclaim God's truth.Our prayer is that you will join with us in running the race and in broadcasting the Good News that Jesus Christ is truly the greatest Love worth finding.",

Todd’s true joy is being able to reproduce a 24/7 kingdom lifestyle in every believer. His heart is to activate people in the simplicity of who they really are and confront the barriers that hold them back from being who God created them to be.

Warner Wallace, cold-case detective and author of Cold-Case Christianity (A Homicide Detective Investigates the Claims of the Gospels). We examine the case for the Christian Worldview from an evidential perspective and do our best to tell it like it is. With the rules of evidence clearly in mind, we examine the case for the existence of God, the reality of dualism, the reliability of the Biblical text, and the deity of Jesus. Along the way we also take a critical look at the nature of the Christian Church in America today. Why are so many young people leaving the church? Why are so many older Christians apathetic and unengaged? Why do so few Christians understand what they believe, and why do even fewer understand WHY they believe it? Join us each week as we sort through the evidence for the Christian Worldview and examine the life of the Church. Please visit our websites at www.STR.org and www.ColdCaseChristianity.com.",

On this show, we’ll listen to one another, problem solve together, and ultimately entrust everything to our Lord. If this is your first time tuning in, here’s how the show goes: Each episode, I'll address three to four of your questions. I’ll cover everything from Catholic teaching to moral dilemmas to relationship advice. I'm not perfect, and I can’t guarantee that my advice is going to make things easy, but I'll do my best to share what I've learned during my time as a priest, pastor, and friend.

He then began sharing the vivid details of his story through a 44-episode memoir, published as one episode per day. He called the story Blue Babies Pink. \n\nWithin days, Blue Babies Pink began to spread through social media. Thousands of readers tuned in, eagerly waiting for the daily installment to be released. Readers resonated deeply with Brett's struggle with faith, loneliness, shame, singleness, workaholism, and uncertainty. \n\nCalled \"the Netflix of blogs,\" more than 100,000 people have read Blue Babies Pink to date.",
