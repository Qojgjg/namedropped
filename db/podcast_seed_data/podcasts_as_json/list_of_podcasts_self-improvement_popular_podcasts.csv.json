In fact we talk about a lot of things that tree huggers would love: appreciation of beauty, gratitude, positive emotions, relationships and well, love. However we, that is positive psychologists and positive psychology practitioners buried ourselves in books, set out to experiment and then write it all up in a writing style that is about as exciting to read as watching an avocado turn brown. And that's the problem: if you are not an academic you probably want a little bit more excitement, than pages and pages of densely written journals can provide. Even if you are an academic, who has time to read all the interesting stuff out there anyways? So in an effort to save your eyes taking on a comically rectangular shape the positive psychology podcast brings the science of the good life to your earbuds. It's not all treehugger style though; sometimes we might get quite serious, for example when exploring things like post-traumatic growth or positive parenting. Subscribe if you want to benefit from the scientific insights into happiness and meaning while you are on the go. Let me know where you are while you are listening to this. If you like it review it, because that's the only way other people can find it too.",

Personally, I love memorizing things quickly, because it not only enables me to learn anything I want to learn really quickly, it also frees up my time to go beyond mere memorization of rote facts because memorization is now so fast.

Albert Einstein said, “Everything in life is vibration.” You’re literally, energetically attracting career opportunities, good health, relationships, respect of your peers and sometimes even money, when you live at your optimal vibration. Tesla said, “If you want the secrets of the Universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration.” We explore how quantum physics meets psychology. We discuss how everything from the food you eat to your thoughts can raise or lower your vibration. When you discover the secrets to a high-vibration life you obtain health and happiness.\n\n\n\nTo get to the show notes go to https://greensmoothiegirl.com/your-high-vibration-life/",

In each episode, one of the two becomes a human guinea pig as she tries to solve a specific work-related problem. Using the advice of so-called productivity experts, the duo tackles obstacles like ineffective to-do lists, overflowing inboxes and unruly meetings. Self-improvement is, by some estimates, a $10 billion sector, but can any of the productivity hacks these experts preach actually improve Francesca and Rebecca's work lives? Follow along with their attempts, insights and missteps, and maybe find a solution that will work for you.",

It’s a habit that 80% of the population has been brainwashed into believing is the norm.  And, it’s a habit that is very simple to quit… you simply stop drinking.  \n\nAlcohol Mastery focuses on the immense gains you get when you move away from alcohol,  rather than dwelling on the loss of the precious poison.  It’s about stepping away from the alcoholic label, perpetuating the AA type ‘alcoholic forever’ mentality, and blaming the alcohol instead of the drinker.\n\nAlcohol Mastery is about guiding you onwards, toward your new life of freedom, control, and self respect. \n\nSome of the topics covered include frequently asked questions about common problems you might encounter when you quit drinking, general quitting alcohol tips and advice, and regular updates about my stop drinking alcohol journey. \n\nThere are new episodes being posted all the time, so make sure you come back regularly.\n\nOnwards and upwards!",

I shared A LOT on my YouTube channel as I learned and changed, but I want to share more about: HOW I started trusting myself and increasing my confidence, how I began my recovery from codependency, how I deal with the struggles of loving a spouse in recovery from addiction, and how I lost 35lbs in 5 months! I don’t want anybody else stuck where I was. If I can help one person by telling my story, then it’s worth it. We all deserve to live a fulfilled life, and we all CAN!

        "description": "If you’re done with binge eating, this podcast is for you. If you’re tired of that “ugh” feeling after a binge—of those moments of regret, distress, and shame—this podcast is for you. Done Bingeing is the podcast that teaches actionable strategies and the latest brain science to deal with urges to binge, to restore your trust in your ability to feed yourself normal amounts of food, and to return to your natural weight. Martha combines her coaching expertise, her work with trusted health care professionals, her formal education, and her 30-year battle to end binge eating to teach cognitive-based and body-positive tools to find freedom from binge eating. The Done Bingeing Podcast offers a broad and deep approach to recovering from binge eating that respects the spectrum of treatment options available and the unique needs of each person who struggles with binge eating. From the urges to binge to just plain life, Martha will help you navigate common triggers to bingeing and help you heal from a place of power instead of from a place of powerlessness. You’ll be surprised how much easier this journey can be when you know how you manage your mind! Have a question or topic you’d like to see covered on the podcast?

I will share with you my experiences as a creative, introverted, Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) in a world that doesn’t seem to stop shouting, assuming, and expecting things from us. Through my blog and podcast I address some of the subtle and absurd challenges that we face when we choose to live differently and challenge the status quo.

The host and guests uncover and share the shortest route to finding your purpose, passion, and place in the world. The Your Better Life Podcast is created and hosted by best-selling author and simple living expert Gary Collins. He is a former US Federal Special Agent and a military intelligence officer who takes a no-BS-no-fluff-what’s-really-working-now approach to live the life you really want and cutting the meaningless clutter and drama. Topics range from simple living, entrepreneurship, personal freedom, finding your purpose, financial freedom, optimal health, living off the grid, and decluttering your life, just to name a few. What makes Your Better Life podcast different from the others? Gary doesn’t just talk the talk he walks the walk. He is known for being blunt, to the point and teaching by experience, not the standard fair today of “fake it till you make it.” He calls those people the “false prophets,” and there is no place for them on the show.",

After many years of this struggle, eventually reaching rock bottom with agoraphobia, I finally had enough and decided to create a whole new identity for myself. I studied Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, adopted a coach, rid myself of bad habits, and pursued through incredible resistance in order to reach my higher self.\n\nNow, as a Cognitive Behaviorist and NLP Master Practitioner, I aim to offer honest content that provides informative and relatable information about the many areas of anxiety. My mission is to provide a structured step by step approach to overcoming anxiety and sensitization, through CBT and NLP practices, and to build an honest and trustworthy rapport with those who seek help for their life challenges.",
