Jennie has a master's in Biblical studies from Dallas Theological Seminary and lives in Dallas, Texas, with her husband, Zac and their four children.\n\nOn this season of the podcast: \n\nSo many of us live stuck. Stuck in trying to seem perfect. Stuck in sadness. Stuck feeling numb. Stuck pursuing more stuff to make us happy. Stuck in something we can't even name. These stuck places often go unattended inside of us and they are shaping our lives more than we would like to think. \n\nWe've been trying to fix this feeling with everything but... God. He has a plan for these spaces inside of us, the places we feel broken, but we have to go to Him. \n\nSeason 2 of the Made for This Podcast is here! And we’re going to get UNSTUCK. Let’s talk about anger, discontentment, overwhelm, fear and sadness…. some of the places we all get stuck. There will be interviews and Scripture every week. Come on this journey with us to take an honest look at the fight going on inside that leads us to the God who can set us free!",

This happens primarily through efforts in publishing and broadcasting biblical truth.Love Worth Finding began in 1987, as a response to several requests for tapes of messages by pastor and Bible teacher Adrian Rogers. He relates that \"soon the requests began to grow to the point that we knew God was leading us into a wider ministry.\" As an extension of Dr. Rogers' pulpit ministry Love Worth Finding provided that role and continues today.Dr. Rogers stated, \"I believe God wants us to proclaim the message of salvation in the power of the Holy Spirit by every means possible. Thats our commitment at Love Worth Finding.\"In response to many who are asking,has that purpose changed since the home-going of Dr. Rogers? No, God wants us to continue to proclaim the message of salvation. The messenger may be gone, but the message must continue. Millions still have not heard the precious name of Jesus or know His redeeming grace.So our race is not over. We must still rununtil Jesus comes. If you believe in what God has called LWF to do,we invite you to help us proclaim God's truth.Our prayer is that you will join with us in running the race and in broadcasting the Good News that Jesus Christ is truly the greatest Love worth finding.",

To help our listeners achieve that aim, every Wednesday, the original Positive Head, Brandon Beachum, interviews a different consciousness change-maker that is helping to pave the way for humanity as we collectively transition into a state of expanded consciousness and awareness. On the other weekdays, Brandon and Dr. Erica Middlemiss take turns hosting solo episodes as they feature clips from various philosophers and teachers, take questions from listeners, features Mystic Manor retreat guests, and dig into a plethora of mind-expansive topics that will help to expand your perspective and keep your soul fed on a regular basis. Occasionally, Alexa Houser steps in on Friday's to highlight what magical things some of our listeners are up to in the world on the (p)HeAd Posse episodes. It's a daily conscious effort and it takes a tribe to help us all keep a Positive Head, which is why we’re here to help you keep your consciousness elevated five days a week!",

Todd believes that redemption and righteousness are the foundational keys for living life as a new creation in Christ. After God opened Todd’s eyes to this truth, Todd’s foremost desire is to see the Holy Spirit flowing through believers everywhere that they go–at work, school, grocery stores, malls, gas stations, and more. Todd’s true joy is being able to reproduce a 24/7 kingdom lifestyle in every believer. His heart is to activate people in the simplicity of who they really are and confront the barriers that hold them back from being who God created them to be.

Warner Wallace, cold-case detective and author of Cold-Case Christianity (A Homicide Detective Investigates the Claims of the Gospels). We examine the case for the Christian Worldview from an evidential perspective and do our best to tell it like it is. With the rules of evidence clearly in mind, we examine the case for the existence of God, the reality of dualism, the reliability of the Biblical text, and the deity of Jesus. Along the way we also take a critical look at the nature of the Christian Church in America today. Why are so many young people leaving the church? Why are so many older Christians apathetic and unengaged? Why do so few Christians understand what they believe, and why do even fewer understand WHY they believe it? Join us each week as we sort through the evidence for the Christian Worldview and examine the life of the Church. Please visit our websites at www.STR.org and www.ColdCaseChristianity.com.",

Because we’re all hungry for more frank, fun conversations about how we make sense of life. From PRX and KUER.",

Josh is the podcast where I hear you out and do my best to help you navigate the tricky times in life when our Catholic Faith doesn’t give you an easy “fill-in-the blank” answer. On this show, we’ll listen to one another, problem solve together, and ultimately entrust everything to our Lord. If this is your first time tuning in, here’s how the show goes: Each episode, I'll address three to four of your questions. I’ll cover everything from Catholic teaching to moral dilemmas to relationship advice. I'm not perfect, and I can’t guarantee that my advice is going to make things easy, but I'll do my best to share what I've learned during my time as a priest, pastor, and friend.
