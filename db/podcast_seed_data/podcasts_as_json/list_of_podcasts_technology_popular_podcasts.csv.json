Will you get all that from this show? Absolutely! And a lot more, but not in way you expect. This show is a personality driven show hosted by powerhouses and podcasting industry experts Jessica Kupferman and Elsie Escobar (supported by their producer John.) They will give you insightful, wise, expert advice about all aspects about the podcasting industry, from advertising and sponsorships, to the latest and greatest microphones and workflows, to how the podcasting industry is failing and thriving. You will also get the reality of what it takes to podcast as working from home women and moms running their own businesses and supporting a vibrant community of women podcasters nearing 10k members.\n\nIf you don't like chit chat, banter and feeling like you're hanging out with Elsie and Jess at their kitchen table (or eavesdropping on them) while they drop some brilliant wisdom about podcasting (and possibly 800 other subjects), go ahead and save yourself some time and move along now",
