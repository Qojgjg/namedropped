The Boston Globe’s Spotlight Team, best known for its investigation of the sexual abuse scandal inside the Catholic Church, takes a hard look at the crisis facing football through the lens of Aaron Hernandez’s life and terrible crimes.\nFrom Wondery, the podcast team that brought you Dr. Death, Spotlight asks: Did a brain badly damaged by football contribute to Hernandez’s violent behavior? Did he keep secrets about his sexuality that collided with a hyper-masculine football culture? Did elite coaches and teams look the other way as Hernandez was spiraling out of control?\nSpotlight uncovered new documents, audio, and interviews to go deep into the story of what happened to Aaron Hernandez, and what it means for those of us who cheer on a violent game. ",

It went dormant for a few years, but Gary started it back up in 2015, writing about a myriad of topics.  In the summer of 2016, Chris reached out to Gary about the idea of starting a podcast.  Our first show (Aug 2016) was recorded on a cellphone.  Now, we've included YouTube videos to the podcast!\n\nFrom previews and predictions, to the best \"against the spread\" bets during the season, to the latest sports news and opinions, WCE has everything you’re looking for in a sports show!\n\nSubscribe now, join team #WinningCuresEverything, and make sure to comment!
