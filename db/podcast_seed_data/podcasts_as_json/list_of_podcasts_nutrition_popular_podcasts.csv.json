When you practice Body Kindness®, you create a more satisfying life by being good to yourself. Learn how self-compassion and acceptance help you cultivate a “caregiver” voice and quiet the “inner critic”. HAES Dietitian and Certified Exercise Physiologist Rebecca Scritchfield and her guests have interesting conversations about the cultural influences that keep you stuck in “diet prison” and how you can break free to create meaningful changes in your life. Instead of dieting, you’ll practice self-care, including better sleep, flexible eating patterns, having more fun, and moving in way that feels good, not punishing. Regular guest Bernie Salazar, a former Biggest Loser “winner” shares why he’s happier and healthier as a fat man.",

We bring you, various experts from around the world and explore topics from a scientific perspective.\n\nA big welcome to The Gut Health Gurus podcast brought to you by Food Scientist & Registered Nutritionist,  \nKriben Govender. Around 8 years ago, Kriben's life imploded. He was extremely depressed, overweight and lacking in energy and vibrancy. He found himself alone in an apartment, ready to end his life. A combination of workplace bullying, stress, a struggle with anxiety and depression and a collapsed marriage resulted in a sense of worthlessness. For the sake of his 3 young boys, Kriben soldiered on and discovered the importance of gut health on his mental wellbeing.  He found inspiration in the work of Dr Natasha Campbell McBride through here book Gut and Psychology Syndrome (GAPS): Natural Treatment for Autism, Dyspraxia, A.D.D., Dyslexia, A.D.H.D., Depression, Schizophrenia. He started to follow a GAPS diet, made homemade fermented foods like kefir, kombucha and sauerkraut, adopted a transcendental meditation (TM) and yoga practice, attended cognitive behaviour therapy sessions with a psychologist, learned the Meisner and Alexander acting techniques - all which helped him overcome his struggle with anxiety and depression. \n\nKriben holds a honours degree in Applied Science (Food Science and Technology) and is a member of the Australian Institute of Food Science and Technology and Nutrition Society of Australia.\n\nWith more than 20 years of Food industry experience in the field of Research and Development, Quality Assurance and Procurement, Kriben intimately understands the food supply chain and the interaction between diet and the gut microbiome. He has personally visited more than 100 food processing sites across the world.",

She is also the person who re-launched the Pilates Method in 1991 and made it a household name in a  decade. She’s THE expert in diet and exercise that you’ve never heard of, and when you listen, you’ll find out why the \"wellness\" industry  wants her voice  silenced. A Pilates client in the 60’s-- and still a devotee-- she has also worked in the hair, cosmetic, fitness, exercise and diet industries for five decades. She will  tell you how marketing and the media and money conspired to harm the American body. You won't hear one word about \"healthy\" or  WELLNESS.  Starting with the truth about exercise-- there are only NINE moves-- if its  yoga, pilates, barre, HIIT, cardio or  weight training. Or the lies about how to \"torch calories” or “firm your flab.” And the diets that failed you and  why there is only one away to eat.  How to eat-- not what-- is her specialty. Mostly importantly, she will tell you how to be your own body Expert. What you need to know to  get your best body. Health care realities and global warming inevitabilities will force change in America. This podcast will prepare you to face these coming changes regardless of your age or earnings.

They describe their experiences with body image, weight concerns, diets, food, infertility, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, ADD, ADHD, weight loss attempts, health care, and so much more. \n\nWhat won't you hear? Another crappy diet recommendation. We know diets don't work even though you've been pressured to lose weight to treat PCOS. There is another way to eat and experience life. We can't wait to share with you how.\n\nHosted by dietitian Julie Duffy Dillon and dietitian-in-training Kimmie Singh, they are PCOS experts passionate about fat positive interventions.\n\nWe hope this podcast supports you along your Food Peace journey.

Where we learn to navigate and simplify our lives in this gluten filled world.\n\nMy name is Coral Barajas and I am the founder of Serving Celiacs. I started our Celiac Journey about 4 years ago when my 3 year old daughter Chanelle was first diagnosed with Celiac Disease. Since her diagnosis my youngest daughter Sadie and I have both been diagnosed. That means 3 out of 6 of our family members have Celiac Disease. \n\nI live a 100% gluten free lifestyle and I have to tell you that I have come to I love it! I have  come to realize that I am happier and healthier than I have ever been. After years of suffering, I now have learned to listen to my body, be strong in my will power and not let Celiac disease control my life or more importantly my mind.\n\nIt hasn’t always been easy, I remember the first time I walked into the grocery store and after 3  1/2 hours I left the store with only 2 things in my cart. Crying the entire way home… I quickly realized that I just needed to find my gluten free groove and fast. In this podcast I will be sharing exactly HOW I came to find my groove and in the process created an educational gaming app, a cookbook, the Celiac Coach eCourse, countless webinars and a strong presence on social media.\n\n\nFor the past year I’ve been having this crazy feeling that I just can’t seem to shake, the feeling that I needed to share my voice, share my stories and share my hope with all of you In a deeper and more intimate way. And that is what has inspired me to start this podcast. And I am more pumped than ever to share my greatest gems with all of you!\n\nI will be featuring and interviewing incredible people, organizations and brands that are making our gluten free world just that much better. We will be talking about things that really matter. The day to day living and situations that we can learn and overcome together.\n\nWether YOU have celiac disease, someone you love does or you eat gluten free for any reason, this is the podcast that will motivate, inspire and teach you the ways without losing your mind!\n\nMy hope here with the Gluten Free You and Me Podcast, is that every time you finish an episode- you will leave feeling more informed, positive, uplifted, and inspired to overcome any obstacles you are facing and know that you are not alone in this journey.\n\nDon’t forget to subscribe so that you don’t miss an episode cause believe me you are going to love the content we share here!

The podcast exposes common myths and misconceptions about health and wellness and critiques the diet culture and wellness culture that we're living in. Shohreh's goal is to help her listeners redefine health and wellness for themselves by delving into all the aspects of health that often get ignored, including mental health, emotional health, spiritual health, sexual health, financial health, social health, environmental health, and occupational health. While the podcast is focused on health and wellness, Shohreh recognizes that neither health nor wellness is a moral obligation and that they can’t be discussed in a vacuum - they are affected by racism, sexism, capitalism, ageism, classism, and more.",

They’re dieting; counting calories or macros or having long lists of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ foods. Unfortunately for all their hard work, people aren’t getting the results they’re hoping for. Chris Sandel is a nutritionist and sees these kinds of problems all the time; people who are trying to be healthy, but their attempts are causing more harm than good. In this podcast Chris looks at what health really means, not just the appearance of health but genuine health. He interviews guests as well as doing informative podcasts on his own. His areas of expertise are diet recovery, eating disorders, body image, hormonal health (fertility and thyroid issues), metabolism, habit formation, nutrition, eating habits, physiology, exercise and movement. There is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to health, and this podcast will teach you how to listen to your body so you can be best supporting it nutritionally, mentally and emotionally.",

A few years back I looked at the scale and I weighed 327 lbs and I set a goal to lose 100lbs which I DID! Then I opened up my own fitness studio and took what I learned and applied it to my hometown clients through unique weight loss, exercise, and nutrition programs and protocols. My hometown clients lost 35,000 LBS over a span of just 5 years! Now I'm on a Million Pound Mission with a goal of inspiring YOU and people like you that want to get healthy and get back in control of their nutrition, fitness, health, and lifestyle. The goal is to produce over one million pounds of transformation results through my free podcasts, blog, and online courses and coaching.\n\nEvery week I will deliver a high energy dose of Transformation Education with my best motivation, strategy, and tips. I also love to bring on special guests that can help drop some knowledge and add value to anyone's transformation process.\n\nLike I always say....the perfect time to start is NOW.....so LET'S DO THIS!",

Can you follow him and have the same results?\n\nSubscribe to the series and find out.\n\nPlus; listen to Jon interview health and fitness experts who explain why Low Carb High Fat (LCHF) is the future for all morbidly obese people like Gaunty.\n\nSubscribe today and keep up to date with Jon's progress. Get motivated by Jon's famous no-nonsense straight talking. \n\nThrough his work as an award winning broadcaster, many thousands of people already follow Jon for his unique way of getting to the heart of big issues in a way that others don't dare. \n\nJon wants his weight loss and health discovery to help you to lose weight too, feel good, and take control of your health - and even reverse Type 2 Diabetes as he is doing.",

There are no tricks, gimmicks or products to buy. The hosts, Scott Mitchell and Melanie Douglass discuss the hottest health trends, tackle tough questions, play games for a few laughs and issue weekly health challenges that you and your family can implement for lasting better health. Scott, former NFL and University of Utah quarterback, was once a contestant on The Biggest Loser. He lost 126 pounds, but it all came back and now he is determined to find a way to keep it off while still living his busy life. Melanie, a registered dietician and personal trainer for 20+ years (and busy mother of four!) is here to help Scott (and all of you) find health solutions that work. Anyone can participate. For free. It just takes a commitment to real health and a willingness to try new, simple things. Find us on Facebook or Instagram to join the movement.",
