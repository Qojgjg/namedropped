Hosted by Grammy Award-winner and MacArthur “Genius” Fellow Rhiannon Giddens, Aria Code is produced in partnership with The Metropolitan Opera.\nEach episode dives into one aria — a feature for a single singer — and explores how and why these brief musical moments have imprinted themselves in our collective consciousness and what it takes to stand on the Met stage and sing them.\nA wealth of guests—from artists like Rufus Wainwright and Ruben Santiago-Hudson to non-musicians like Dame Judi Dench and Dr. Brooke Magnanti, author of The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl—join Rhiannon and the Met Opera’s singers to understand why these arias touch us at such a human level, well over a century after they were written. Each episode ends with the aria, uninterrupted and in full, recorded from the Met Opera stage.\n Aria Code is produced in partnership with WQXR, The Metropolitan Opera and WNYC Studios.",

We discuss their musical origins, and we trace a few of their embarrassing high school bands and other associated bands that happened before they broke out. This show digs deeper than any Wikipedia page or band bio would ever dare to go. And, sometimes, the guests will even share some of their old songs. You can expect to hear a lot of interesting, informative and hopefully entertaining anecdotes about all of the bands along the way.\n\nMy First Band is sponsored by Boulevard Brewing.

        "description": "Far Beyond Metal is a metal interview show that sets out to defy what it means to be metal by exploring the minds of the musicians, writers, and metal media staples behind the genre that is largely made up adults growling like monsters. Guests discuss their earliest musical origins, their careers, current projects, and more. The “more” frequently includes Prince for some reason.\n\nHost Daniel Cordova has spent almost a decade being obnoxious in the Sacramento metal scene. He had a radio show with KSSU, currently writes for Metal Injection, and for the past three years has produced FBM podcast independently.\n\nThis show is an homage to metal and the cheesy voices announcing it. \n\nFarBeyondMetalPodcast.com\nTwitter: @_FarBeyondMetal\n\nTheme courtesy of Century Media Records & Devin Townsend himself",
