How they wrestle with life’s big questions. And the way spirituality intersects with their daily struggles and joys. These days, especially on social media, the word “Preach” is used as a way to encourage someone to share their story. To validate. To tell them that they deserve to be heard. That’s what this show is about. Empowering the people — some of them famous, all of them fascinating — who live in the messy middle of faith. Because we’re all hungry for more frank, fun conversations about how we make sense of life. From PRX and KUER.",

Since its inception in 1898, reconciliation and healing through at-one-ment — the unity of men and women with God and one another — has been the mission of the Friars' work and ministries to people of every race, religion, and walk of life.\n\nThe social ministries of the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement serve the poor, the needy, and the homeless, people living with HIV/AIDS, those in hospitals and prisons, and people seeking recovery from alcoholism and chemical dependency. The ecumenical work makes them leaders of the international movement to heal the divisions within Christianity, and among all faiths. Finally, their pastoral ministry is the vigorous outreach that brings atonement to diverse peoples worldwide.",

It is daunting to find the TRUTH of God since it has been replaced by man made religions.  Yet you do not have to be an expert in the Bible to know that the Bible speaks of the 144,000 which will come from the 12 Tribes of Israel.  This number does not represent how many will be saved.  It is instead a guide to the true teachers that will be raised in the last days that will lead HIS people to follow the Messiah and King of Israel (Jesus Christ in English).  Do not be discouraged by the fact that there are so many religions, teachers, etc..  Do not let any misconception prevent you from the good news.  Do not let the thought come into your head telling you are not Jewish.  Since all those whose forefathers are of so called Negro, Native American Indian, Hispanic descent; scattered throughout North, Central, South America, and the four corners are of the earth are not \"Jewish\" they are indeed the Biblical true actual children of Israel.  Ephesians 2:12 “That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:”  Take the first step to returning back to your heritage for faith comes by hearing!",

We seek to reform religious education so everyone can be spiritually bold, free of manipulation and filled with deep peace.\n\nAfter 20+ years of professional work in religious education and educational nonprofits, hosts Jeff Mallinson (D.Phil. Oxford, philosophy and religion professor, author and speaker) and Stacie Mallinson (former nonprofit development professional, and now certified yoga instructor) realized that how we do religious education leads to a susceptibility to abusive behaviors. This is not a show that will focus on abuse, but rather the ways in which rethinking religious education and involvement with churches, sects, and gurus requires training in critical thinking and personal empowerment.",
