All their adventures are meticulously archived and presented by Dr. Q, played by Dennis Quaid. Bear and a Banjo features an original soundtrack, produced by Oscar-winner T-Bone Burnett (O’ Brother Where Art Thou, True Detective), written and performed by series creator Jingle Jared & Grammy-winning songwriter Jason \"Poo Bear” Boyd with original lyrics by Bob Dylan.",

It all started in Miami with the 2 Live Crew, a group that took hip hop and made it faster, harder, and nastier than anything anyone had heard before. But in 1990 their music was declared legally obscene, and what followed is known today as the most controversial trial in the history of hip hop. This group, this city and this trial changed the course of music history as we know it. Mogul Season 2 features exclusive interviews with Miami legends like Trick Daddy, Rick Ross, Trina, Luke Campbell, Brother Marquis, Mr. Mixx, Walshy Fire, and more.",

New Sounds combs recent recordings for one of the most informative and compelling hours on radio, and aims to make the world smaller. For over 25 years, host John Schaefer has been finding the melody in the rainforest and the rhythm in an orchestra of tin cans. Defying rigid categorization and genre pigeonholing, New Sounds offers new ways to hear the ancient language of song. With guest musicians from David Byrne to Meredith Monk to Ravi Shankar to Philip Glass to Christopher O'Riley to Bang On A Can, Schaefer presents performances (both in-studio and from the New Sounds Live concert series) and premieres new works from the classic and operatic to folk and jazz, and anything else in between. Each show has a theme, ranging from post-rock to klezmer to African blues to minimalism. The variety of cultures and styles explored is boundless. Music you may not have known existed and now can't live without.",

Hosted by Grammy Award-winner and MacArthur “Genius” Fellow Rhiannon Giddens, Aria Code is produced in partnership with The Metropolitan Opera.\nEach episode dives into one aria — a feature for a single singer — and explores how and why these brief musical moments have imprinted themselves in our collective consciousness and what it takes to stand on the Met stage and sing them.\nA wealth of guests—from artists like Rufus Wainwright and Ruben Santiago-Hudson to non-musicians like Dame Judi Dench and Dr. Brooke Magnanti, author of The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl—join Rhiannon and the Met Opera’s singers to understand why these arias touch us at such a human level, well over a century after they were written. Each episode ends with the aria, uninterrupted and in full, recorded from the Met Opera stage.\n Aria Code is produced in partnership with WQXR, The Metropolitan Opera and WNYC Studios.",

For Kanye fans, this might be the Ye-centric lyrical discussion you've been waiting for. For musicians and writers, this is practical insight into how one of the best storytellers in music history does what he does. We also have a news show about Kanye, Kim, North, Saint, and Jay-Z. We look at the top 5 posts from Reddit's Kanye community, r/Kanye. And discuss other relevant Ye topics.

The first season is a 4-part limited series detailing the long and fascinating narrative behind \"Losst And Founnd,\" singer and songwriter Harry Nilsson's last album of new music.\nKnown for timeless hits like \"Everybody's Talkin',\" \"Gotta Get Up\" (the theme to Netflix's \"Russian Doll\") and \"Without You,\" Harry was working on his final album right up to his untimely death in 1994, at the age of 52. Now, 25 years later, producer and collaborator Mark Hudson (Ringo Starr, Aerosmith, Ozzy Osbourne) and a cadre of friends, such as Jim Keltner, Van Dyke Parks, Jimmy Webb and even his son Kiefo Nilsson, have helped bring the album to life. \"Final Sessions\" is an in-depth exploration of Harry's music, his close friendship with the Beatles, his family life, and how his backstory informed his classic songs.\nA new episode airs every Friday in November, leading up to the release of \"Losst And Founnd\" on November 22nd.",

SOME shall be dispelled!!\nMy name is Jamie Lidell and I'm gonna delve into the heady magic of creating music in a modern studio, probe the depths of production, get tech crazy with mixing tricks, studio skills and equipment. I'll be joined by fellow musicians, engineers and all-round audiophiles who kindly share their tips, stories and ingenious insight from the bizarre world of music production. I shall answer questions and seek knowledge from other music makers on a quest to discover how to make things sound RIGHT. I will also share some studio trickery on each episode as I explore some of my favourite innovations in music tech and my creations... outpourings from the weirdo brain! Welcome to a place for musicians, producers and listeners alike as we \"cheers\" our love of everything audio.",

From the earliest trips he made through the American South with his father, John A. Lomax, beginning in 1933, to his last documentary work in the early 1990s, the program will present seminal artists and performances alongside obscure, unidentified, and previously unheard singers and players, from around America and the world, drawn from the Lomax Collection at the American Folklife Center, Library of Congress. It is produced and hosted by Nathan Salsburg, curator of the Alan Lomax Archive at the Association for Cultural Equity, the non-profit research center and advocacy organization that Lomax founded in 1983.
