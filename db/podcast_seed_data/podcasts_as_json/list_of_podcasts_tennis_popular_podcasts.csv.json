Our biggest goal is to provide entertaining, engaging tennis talk that not only is a pleasure to listen to but also helps maximize your tennis enjoyment and success in your matches!What topics will be covered on the Shankcast podcast? Nothing will be off limits and no stone will be left unturned! You’ll hear the hosts debate whether or not it’s kosher to try doubles opponents, if the unhand serve (ala Nick Kyrgios) is a smart play or disrespectful, how well they think they would fare against Serena Williams, the biggest mistakes tennis parents make, and much, much more! No matter what tennis topic is being discussed Ian, Megan and Kevin will share their real, candid, unfiltered thoughts so you can benefit from their many decades of experience as players, coaches, and mentors around the court. Subscribing to the Shankcast is hands down the best way to automatically get each episode as its published, each and every week!
