His books include The End of Faith, Letter to a Christian Nation, The Moral Landscape, Free Will, Lying, Waking Up, and Islam and the Future of Tolerance (with Maajid Nawaz). The End of Faith won the 2005 PEN Award for Nonfiction. His writing and public lectures cover a wide range of topics—neuroscience, moral philosophy, religion, meditation practice, human violence, rationality—but generally focus on how a growing understanding of ourselves and the world is changing our sense of how we should live. \n\nHarris's work has been published in more than 20 languages and has been discussed in The New York Times, Time, Scientific American, Nature, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, and many other journals. He has written for The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Economist, The Times (London), The Boston Globe, The Atlantic, The Annals of Neurology, and elsewhere.\n\nSam Harris received a degree in philosophy from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in neuroscience from UCLA.",

The story we learn starts with Sputnik, then President Kennedy’s challenge, and ends with triumph: an American flag on the lunar surface. But in the 50 years that have passed since the moon landing, as presidential documents have been declassified and secret programs have been revealed, a wilder story has begun to emerge. “Moonrise,” a new Washington Post narrative mini-series, digs into the nuclear arms race of the Cold War, the transformation of American society and politics, and even the birth of science fiction, to unearth what really drove us to the moon. Join host Lillian Cunningham as she uncovers a story that has so much to reveal about America -- and about the dreams and nightmares of being human on this Earth.",

What she found might surprise even the staunchest non-believer. This legendary creature represents a mystery that still captures our imaginations and Sasquatch is as popular now as it’s ever been. Part of this is tongue-in-cheek—Bigfoot as hipster accessory. But many people take Sasquatch seriously—perfectly rational people who swear to its existence. Why does this creature ignite our imagination? Where does that fascination come from? And why does it persist?",

The great controversies: nature and nurture, free will, consciousness, human differences, self and society. Students are exposed to the range of theoretical perspectives including biological, evolutionary, cognitive, and psychoanalytic. One of the best aspects of Psychology is that you are the subject matter. This makes it possible to do many demonstrations in lecture that allow you to experience the topic under study. Lectures work in tandem with the textbook. The course breaks into small recitations sections to allow discussion, oral presentations, and individual contact with instructors.",

It explores topics such as perception, communication, learning, memory, decision-making, religion, persuasion, love, lust, hunger, art, fiction, and dreams. We will look at how these aspects of the mind develop in children, how they differ across people, how they are wired-up in the brain, and how they break down due to illness and injury.\n\nThis class was recorded in Spring 2007.",

In May 2013, the APA released a new edition, the DSM-5 which has significantly impacted the multiaxial system presented in this series and has significantly impacted some of the diagnostic categories and diagnoses.  An updated podcast series based on the new DSM-5 were made available in Spring 2015. \n\nThis course is intended to provide a survey of theories and etiology of abnormal behavior and its social significance; description of symptoms; consideration of techniques of therapy and theories of prevention.\n\nThe material in this series related to mental health diagnoses is based on the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision which was published in 2000.\n\nThe podcasts presented in this series will include live class recordings of lecture presentations and additional pre-recorded segments that focus on frequently asked questions and concepts that often provide a challenge for many students.  These recordings may also be supplemented by PDF files or handouts designed to further enhance the student’s understanding of the field of abnormal psychology.  These materials are intended to supplement the traditional classroom approach of my courses and to enhance the student’s learning experience.\n\nTarget audience should include current students and others who wish to know more about the topic areas. The materials will not be textbook specific so that they will be useful to others. For HACC students, the purpose is to allow them an opportunity to review or catch up on lectures/class periods that they may have missed or misunderstood. For other learners outside of HACC, the purpose is to supply another resource for their learning that is both entertaining and educational.\n\nThe course was originally recorded during the Fall Semester 2010 with some updates as necessary.\n\nPlease send any suggestions/feedback to drbailey@hacc.edu.\n\nI hope you enjoy listening and thanks for exploring the world of abnormal psychology with me.

The School of Psych podcast is less about giving \"5 simple tips for a great marriage\" and more about people sharing deep and heartfelt stories like \"what I learned about the psychology of fear from dangling off the ledge of 1,000 ft tall building\" or \"how I went from a reluctant bride to counseling couples as New York's 'Wedding Doctor'\", and \"how my journey to learn about unrequited love and romantic obsession began after becoming obsessed with someone who didn't love me back\". Along the way, we'll learn about love, life, loss, fear, anger, joy, creativity, and happiness. Authors, sociologists, psychologists, journalists, therapists, artists, and more will be asked to dig deep into their own personal passions, triumphs, heartbreaks, failures, and eureka moments to help us learn more about who we are, what we think, and how we relate.

At extremes of scale, speed and time, our perceptions of the world prove hard to reconcile with established physical law. Here, at the cutting edge of physics where we attempt to reconcile the bizarre domain of quantum mechanics with the cosmic vastness of relativity, we must increasingly rely on new ways of thinking, seeing and experimenting to probe the principles which underlie everything.

From the extensive requirements of difficult prerequisites to having thousands of hours of experience, becoming a PA can be quite the challenge. Savanna Perry from The PA Platform Blog reveals all of her advice on how to reach your goals of becoming a PA.  Savanna has been where you are and understands what it takes to look good on paper, and dazzle in an interview to land a spot in a PA program. While Savanna admits that she doesn’t know everything, she has successfully helped hundreds of Pre-PA hopefuls with personal statements and interviews to help them gain acceptance into PA school and start successful careers. Some of the topics that will be covered on this podcast include CASPA, personal statements, GRE, how to study effectively, interview skills, shadowing, letters of recommendation, how to find jobs, and interviews with other practicing physician assistants.",

From improved plants, animals and microbes, the technologies known as genetic engineering (familiarly \"GMOs\") are mostly misunderstood and oftentimes maligned.  These technologies are well regarded by scientists, yet approached skeptically by a concerned public.  The disparity has been conjured by prevalent misinformation on the internet and in activist literature and documentaries. At the same time farmers and scientists have not been good communicators about what the technology is, and isn't. \n\n\n\nThe Talking Biotech Podcast is a weekly podcast that provides science-based discussion on current topics.  The discussion is led by Dr. Kevin Folta, a professor with training in these areas and familiarity with the scholarly literature.  Guest will describe current issues in biotechnology, twitter-based questions are answered, and there is a segment dedicated to plant genetic improvement from domestication through today's breeding efforts. \n\n\n\nThe podcast is geared to anyone wishing to know more about biotechnology, its risks and benefits, and how it can be used to help farmers, the needy, consumers and the environment.",

        "description": "Host Dr. Wendy Walsh uses science, personal interviews and pop culture to reveal that mating strategy is the secret evolutionary motivation for most every human behavior. We are wired to reproduce. Even when we are not thinking about sex, our ancient programming makes us respond to reproductive cues that impact just about every decision we make. Using evolutionary psychology, Mating Matters examines relationships, sexuality, and how society and culture shape us all. Dr. Wendy Walsh looks at the biological, psychological and sociological underpinnings of love, attachment and gender dynamics.  Visit www.DrWendyWalsh.com for more.\n\nPlease be aware this podcast talks scientifically about topics that include sex, violence and other aspects of the human condition that may be challenging. Adult language is used periodically.\n\nMating Matters Message Line: 323-207-8277",

Easy answer: Your brain...right? \n\nThink again. \n\nIt's hard to believe, there is no explanation in modern science how a brain could create our subjective experience of being alive (\"consciousness\"). Science Magazine has called this \"hard problem\" the #2 question remaining in all of science. \n\nWhere Is My Mind? explores a revolutionary hypothesis: What if consciousness comes from outside the body? The show is hosted by Mark Gober, a consciousness researcher and author of An End to Upside Down Thinking, who happens to be a former Wall Street banker working in Silicon Valley. \n\nWhy does this show matter? Well, if consciousness is not native to the brain, would phenomena like telepathy, precognition, near-death experiences, afterdeath communications, and so much more not only be possible... but be PREDICTED? \n\nPlus, what happens when we die? Are psychics real? How could a young child accurately report memories of someone else's life and death? \n\nThe implications could shift our collective worldview and even impact how we treat one another... so don't miss it.",
