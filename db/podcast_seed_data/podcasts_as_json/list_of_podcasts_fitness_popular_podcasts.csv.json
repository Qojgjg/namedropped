Each week they discuss how the training from the previous week went, share tips they’ve either discovered through experience or that they’ve gleaned off the web, and cover many other topics that come up along the way.\n\n\n\nThe Gomers kicked off their podcast on Sept 10, 2008 and have been going strong for 10 years and 8 very full seasons. They have trained for and run half marathons, full marathons, and triathlons in their endeavor to become healthier and find enjoyment in new activities. Even with breadth of running experience, still they are Gomers at heart.",

        "description": "The Garage Gym Athlete Podcast was born from a community of underground athletes you've probably never heard of before. The idea for this show stemmed from Jerred Moon, the creator of Garage Gym Athlete programming, when he would do weekly coaching calls with Garage Gym Athletes. He found each athlete had such a unique story, an inspirational journey, and had overcome their own set of challenges that could help impact other athletes...but only if the stories could be told to all. The athletes all have a diverse background; some from Powerlifting, CrossFit, Olympic Lifting, Endurance Training, Military Operators, Collegiate Athletes, Spartan Racers, Obstacle Course Racers, and many other forms of physical training. It takes the experience of these athletes braving the extreme heat, bitter cold, early mornings, and late nights to tackle their training and become athletes. This podcast is for Garage Gym Athletes and by Garage Gym Athletes. Athletes share their experience (whether a beginner or advanced), share their knowledge, and give us a glimpse into the life of a Garage Gym Athlete!! We all know the gym SUCKS...And it comes with a long commute, crowds of people, occupied equipment, and much worse...Also, home fitness SUCKS...Because the treadmill becomes a clothing rack...Or you spend an hour with a DVD jumping around in your living room...But we're changing the game...By providing the other guy (who's strapped for time) with intelligent training to help them perform and look like an athlete. Our aim is for this podcast to inspire your own Garage Gym journey and to pick up as much as you can from other Garage Gym Athletes who are crushing it!!",

After being asked many times over the years if he would ever attempt it… one day, at age 60, he surprised himself—and his partner Caryn—by saying “yes!” \n\nHow does an avid, but recreational cyclist go from seasonal hobby to tackling a 3,000 mile, 12-day ride only completed by 13 people over the age of 60 in its 38-year history? What does it take for a Colorado couple with an already (overly) full life to integrate the learning training, planning, qualifying races, and necessary crew development? Ride along as Rick and Caryn share the ins and outs, ups and downs, and highs and lows of their journey. On route they will talk with others who have attempted Race Across America, their crews, race owners, officials, media, and the many people who are an integral part of the ultra-cycling community.\n\nCan he do it? Will he make it? What will it take for Rick to join the ranks of the few, the proud, the RAAM-finishers in June of 2021? At the end of the day, is it really about the race, or is it the journey that matters most?",

No long intros, disclaimers, or ads, just a guided Vinyasa yoga flow recorded specifically for listening and flowing along. The podcast offers three types of classes – Classic Flow, Gentle Flow, and Power Flow. Gentle Flow offers a slower pace and longer holds. This is not a euphemism for a watered down asana practice. Gentle flow is a legit flow class. Classic Flow offers a mid-line of intensity and pace. Get ready for chaturanga pushups along with power elements in standing postures. Power Flow kicks the levels of intensity up a notch with core work in high planks, holds at bottoms on chaturanga pushups, and standing series that build on one another. Your legs will feel it the next day. So will your arms and core. Is getting stronger not what you came here for? Come flow with me! For more information, visit www.flowwithme.yoga\nThis podcast is intended for experienced yogis. Please listen to your body and go at your own pace. For your safety, make sure you are healthy enough to practice yoga. By listening to this podcast, you are accepting full responsibility for your practice.",

Our podcast helps to uncover how the fitness industry has misled us, and it will show you that if you believe in your ability to improve your body through exercise, you don’t need to rely on diluted or shallow information. From there, you can then educate yourself about the thing you are trying to change – your body! Then, by engaging in a process of self-mastery, you will discover the secrets of exercise.\n\nThink Fit. Be Fit. ensures that people don’t miss out on living a better life because they don't understand that body awareness is a combination of taking feedback, listening, and learning – not self-judgement and meeting societal expectations. We encourage our listeners to not choose unhappiness over uncertainty and to embrace the process!\n\nJennifer Schwartz, host and founder of Impact Your Fitness and Impact Sport Science Group, has helped hundreds of athletes and people around Washington, DC, move without pain and exercise to their fullest potential. Her techniques are best described as the intersection of exercise mechanics, muscle expertise, and embracing curiosity. In Jennifer’s view, the human body is a wonderful teacher if you know how to listen to it, and being open and having fun is part of that amazing process!",

I have drawn my conclusions and ideas from experiences in life, my life events especially. My Tragedies have given me the highest educational degree in creating a better version of you. I believe in having a plan and a way of thinking that can help you become your own entrepreneur, if it’s business, fitness, family or relationships, applying PDE methods will help you be a better you.\n\nI want people to be a part of the PDE, because the purpose of it is to be spread to everyone else that can use it. Because of the hardship and tragedies I have overcome, In a subconscious way I have developed a way to cope with all the obstacles that life can present to you, and most important have created a method to take out the word QUIT out of the equation completely. It’s very difficult to explain what I do or what the PDE is, people seem to grasp the idea more firmly when they spend time listening to my madness, once you give time to listen then you will understand the train of thought behind the PDE.",
