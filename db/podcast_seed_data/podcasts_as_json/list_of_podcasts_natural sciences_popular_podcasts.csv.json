It has no shortage of ways to kill you, and in the fifty years humans have been flying spacecraft around the Earth and out to the moon, the mortal perils have been evident. But ten of the missions were the most harrowing of all. Some of them ended in tragedy, some ended successfully—but all of them involved astronauts playing for the very highest stakes in the very deadliest place.  Countdown tells the tale of those ten missions—some of them American, some Russian. Written and narrated by Jeffrey Kluger—author of Apollo 13 and Apollo 8—Countdown recreates the space crises that every astronaut has feared, and that an unlucky handful were forced to live.",

With nature as our example, we are shaping the farm with edible food forests, perennials, hugelkulture beds, swales, and keyline water systems.  We share our experience in beekeeping and animal husbandry where we pasture raise ducks, chickens, and pigs through the use of rotational grazing and all natural care.  As first time farmers, we are learning how to work the land without pesticides, using heirloom plants, and beyond organic gardening techniques.

From improved plants, animals and microbes, the technologies known as genetic engineering (familiarly \"GMOs\") are mostly misunderstood and oftentimes maligned.  These technologies are well regarded by scientists, yet approached skeptically by a concerned public.  The disparity has been conjured by prevalent misinformation on the internet and in activist literature and documentaries. At the same time farmers and scientists have not been good communicators about what the technology is, and isn't. \n\n\n\nThe Talking Biotech Podcast is a weekly podcast that provides science-based discussion on current topics.  The discussion is led by Dr. Kevin Folta, a professor with training in these areas and familiarity with the scholarly literature.  Guest will describe current issues in biotechnology, twitter-based questions are answered, and there is a segment dedicated to plant genetic improvement from domestication through today's breeding efforts. \n\n\n\nThe podcast is geared to anyone wishing to know more about biotechnology, its risks and benefits, and how it can be used to help farmers, the needy, consumers and the environment.",

Easy answer: Your brain...right? \n\nThink again. \n\nIt's hard to believe, there is no explanation in modern science how a brain could create our subjective experience of being alive (\"consciousness\"). Science Magazine has called this \"hard problem\" the #2 question remaining in all of science. \n\nWhere Is My Mind? explores a revolutionary hypothesis: What if consciousness comes from outside the body? The show is hosted by Mark Gober, a consciousness researcher and author of An End to Upside Down Thinking, who happens to be a former Wall Street banker working in Silicon Valley. \n\nWhy does this show matter? Well, if consciousness is not native to the brain, would phenomena like telepathy, precognition, near-death experiences, afterdeath communications, and so much more not only be possible... but be PREDICTED? \n\nPlus, what happens when we die? Are psychics real? How could a young child accurately report memories of someone else's life and death? \n\nThe implications could shift our collective worldview and even impact how we treat one another... so don't miss it.",

There's a special focus on the fossil record - it is hosted by two paleontologists - but delving into the story of the past isn't limited to dry bones. Today's paleontologists use techniques drawn from other sciences including Physics, Chemistry, Geology, and Biology to figure out what extinct animals were like and how they lived. \n\nWhether you are just starting to learn about the amazing animals that have called this planet home, or you have been fascinated by fossils for a long time, we hope you will join us as we dig into past times.\n\nKeywords: Paleontology, Dinosaurs, Mammals, Reptiles, Birds, Animals, Fossils, Extinction",

Weather itself is interesting and amazing, but what can be even more fascinating and intriguing is how much influence it actually has in our lives.  In this journey we hope you will find yourself laughing, enjoying, and learning and from time to time even uttering \"I did not know that\".\n\n\n\nWeather geek by nature, atmospheric scientist by degree and meteorologist by trade, your host Mark T Jelinek loves talking about the weather.  That love for weather actually drove him back to graduate school after a successful first career in the information services field.  He looks forward to expanding your weather horizons and along the way is likely to be heard muttering  \"I did not know that\".",

The Gestalt Gardener is a long-time favorite on MPB Think Radio, due in no small part to Felder’s laid-back, your-neighbors-might-talk-but-so-what approach to gardening.\nEmail Felder anytime at garden@mpbonline.org and listen Friday mornings at 9 and Saturday mornings at 10 to The Gestalt Gardener on MPB Think Radio.
