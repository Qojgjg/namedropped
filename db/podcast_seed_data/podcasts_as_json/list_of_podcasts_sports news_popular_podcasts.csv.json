        "description": "O podcast “Bola de Chumbo”, da Folha de S.Paulo, é uma série em cinco episódios quinzenais que abordam momentos em que futebol, política e por vezes até guerras se misturaram. Nas histórias aqui contadas, esse esporte das massas é manipulado por ditaduras e governos totalitários, tornando-se estopim de conflitos entre nações e também uma mostra de resistência de povos oprimidos. A apresentação e o roteiro da série são dos repórteres Alberto Nogueira e Bruno Rodrigues. A edição de som é de Thomé Granemann.",
