The great controversies: nature and nurture, free will, consciousness, human differences, self and society. Students are exposed to the range of theoretical perspectives including biological, evolutionary, cognitive, and psychoanalytic. One of the best aspects of Psychology is that you are the subject matter. This makes it possible to do many demonstrations in lecture that allow you to experience the topic under study. Lectures work in tandem with the textbook. The course breaks into small recitations sections to allow discussion, oral presentations, and individual contact with instructors.",

In May 2013, the APA released a new edition, the DSM-5 which has significantly impacted the multiaxial system presented in this series and has significantly impacted some of the diagnostic categories and diagnoses.  An updated podcast series based on the new DSM-5 were made available in Spring 2015. \n\nThis course is intended to provide a survey of theories and etiology of abnormal behavior and its social significance; description of symptoms; consideration of techniques of therapy and theories of prevention.\n\nThe material in this series related to mental health diagnoses is based on the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision which was published in 2000.\n\nThe podcasts presented in this series will include live class recordings of lecture presentations and additional pre-recorded segments that focus on frequently asked questions and concepts that often provide a challenge for many students.  These recordings may also be supplemented by PDF files or handouts designed to further enhance the student’s understanding of the field of abnormal psychology.  These materials are intended to supplement the traditional classroom approach of my courses and to enhance the student’s learning experience.\n\nTarget audience should include current students and others who wish to know more about the topic areas. The materials will not be textbook specific so that they will be useful to others. For HACC students, the purpose is to allow them an opportunity to review or catch up on lectures/class periods that they may have missed or misunderstood. For other learners outside of HACC, the purpose is to supply another resource for their learning that is both entertaining and educational.\n\nThe course was originally recorded during the Fall Semester 2010 with some updates as necessary.\n\nPlease send any suggestions/feedback to drbailey@hacc.edu.\n\nI hope you enjoy listening and thanks for exploring the world of abnormal psychology with me.

Mindfulness is a research based method for dealing with anxiety and trauma.  Psychological and neuroscience studies have found that it is possible to increase the growth of neuronal pathways and retrain our brains in coping with these issues.  Basic techniques like learning to pay attention to our own breathing and looking honestly and non-judgmentally at our hurt places can begin to create an emotional holding space that allows us to live without reacting to the pain and begin deciding how we want to act on the world we find ourselves in.  This becomes the beginning of recovery and, thus, the beginning of a new and abundant life in recovery.  Whether you struggle with anxiety, mental illness, complex trauma, PTSD, addictions or a multitude of other problems, becoming mindful in the way you live is the first step along that path.  I would be honored if this podcast could help you begin that journey.",

The School of Psych podcast is less about giving \"5 simple tips for a great marriage\" and more about people sharing deep and heartfelt stories like \"what I learned about the psychology of fear from dangling off the ledge of 1,000 ft tall building\" or \"how I went from a reluctant bride to counseling couples as New York's 'Wedding Doctor'\", and \"how my journey to learn about unrequited love and romantic obsession began after becoming obsessed with someone who didn't love me back\". Along the way, we'll learn about love, life, loss, fear, anger, joy, creativity, and happiness. Authors, sociologists, psychologists, journalists, therapists, artists, and more will be asked to dig deep into their own personal passions, triumphs, heartbreaks, failures, and eureka moments to help us learn more about who we are, what we think, and how we relate.

        "description": "(PSYC 110) What do your dreams mean? Do men and women differ in the nature and intensity of their sexual desires? Can apes learn sign language? Why can’t we tickle ourselves? This course tries to answer these questions and many others, providing a comprehensive overview of the scientific study of thought and behavior. It explores topics such as perception, communication, learning, memory, decision-making, religion, persuasion, love, lust, hunger, art, fiction, and dreams. We will look at how these aspects of the mind develop in children, how they differ across people, how they are wired-up in the brain, and how they break down due to illness and injury.\n\nThis class was recorded in Spring 2007.",

We are wired to reproduce. Even when we are not thinking about sex, our ancient programming makes us respond to reproductive cues that impact just about every decision we make. Using evolutionary psychology, Mating Matters examines relationships, sexuality, and how society and culture shape us all. Dr. Wendy Walsh looks at the biological, psychological and sociological underpinnings of love, attachment and gender dynamics.  Visit www.DrWendyWalsh.com for more.\n\nPlease be aware this podcast talks scientifically about topics that include sex, violence and other aspects of the human condition that may be challenging.

The emergence, persistence, and demise of social institutions and their co-evolution with distinctive human behaviors - such as altruistic cooperation, out-group hostility and adaptive learning - are typically overlooked in standard economic and other behavioral science models. In line with the well-established scientific tradition of the Institute, this research is characterized by (a) its trans-disciplinary nature, (b) its use of nonlinear dynamical systems to study the explicit out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the relevant processes, (c) and sustained interaction between mathematical modeling and well-defined empirical case studies and problems of potentially great contemporary practical relevance. \n\nNOTE: Please excuse the production quality of some of our older videos.

        "description": "UPDATE: This General Psychology course has been updated and the new series will be available Spring 2015. The new series contains much of the same information, but any discussion of mental health issues will be based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) published by the American Psychiatric Association in May 2013.\n\nThis course is intended to provide an examination and application of major principles of psychology including:  an introduction to scientific and research methods, biological foundations, sensation and perception, learning and conditioning, human development, motivation and emotion, thinking, memory and intelligence, personality theories, stress and coping, social psychology, psychological disorders and their treatment.\n\nThe material in this series related to mental health diagnoses is based on the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision which was published in 2000.\n\nThe podcasts presented in this series will include live class recordings of lecture presentations and additional pre-recorded segments that focus on frequently asked questions and concepts that often provide a challenge for many students.  These recordings may also be supplemented by PDF files or handouts designed to further enhance the student’s understanding of the field of general psychology.  These materials are intended to supplement the traditional classroom approach of my courses and to enhance the student’s learning experience.\n\nTarget audience should include current students and others who wish to know more about the topic areas. The materials will not be textbook specific so that they will be useful to others. For HACC students, the purpose is to allow them an opportunity to review or catch up on lectures/class periods that they may have missed or misunderstood. For other learners outside of HACC, the purpose is to supply another resource for their learning that is both entertaining and educational.\n\nThe course was originally recorded during the Spring Semester 2011 with some updates as necessary.  \n\nPLEASE NOTE:  The section on Psychological Disorders refers to diagnostic classifications based on The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in 2000.\n\nPlease send any suggestions/feedback to drbailey@hacc.edu.\n\nI hope you enjoy listening and thanks for exploring the world of psychology with me.",

        "description": "The Fat Lip is a podcast for and about fat people.\n\nIn some ways fat people are living in a different world than our thin and average-sized peers. Our lives and our experiences are influenced by our fatness all the time, but the outside reactions to fatness can really f**k us up. On a daily basis we are exposed to media that tells us that we’re not worthy of representation and a multi-billion dollar diet industry that is happy to take our money (for products that are proven to not work) while barely disguising its disgust at our very existence. It’s gross, and we’re over it.\n\nTFL strives to be fat positive in a world that often isn’t. We are proud supporters of radical self-love and the fierce defense of your body autonomy.  Fat is not an indicator of health or fitness, and health and fitness aren’t moral imperatives anyway. You don’t have to justify your body or your health to anyone!\n\nOn The Fat Lip, you an expect frank discussion of fat issues in popular media, exploration of fatphobia as it intersects with other forms of oppression, real stories about living, working, and dating in a fat body, big serious topics like the politics of the &amp;amp;quot;obesity epidemic&amp;amp;quot; and tiny fun topics like fatshion and snacks.

We have opened up this conversation to a diverse world of dreamers. Our goal is to help in the process of bringing conscious intent to the state of dreaming — light to the shadowy corners of this experience we all have access to, each time we drift off to sleep.\n\nWe strive to maintain an open and neutral environment as hosts. There are many theories on the process of dreaming and altered states, and we want to hear them all. No information is irrelevant when it comes to dreams. It is in the overlap of individual experiences that we find pathways into the thinking and journeys of the collective.\n\nNox Mente is streamed live every Wednesday night at 9:00pm Eastern on our YouTube channel\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nJoin our Discord server for more real time chatter: https://discord.gg/YDqvWGp\n\nIf you'd like, you may support us on Patreon.",

Starting with the history of the ways in which the West has discovered, translated and written about the Orient, we will consider how power and politics play roles in the production of culture, narrative and performance. This approach assumes that performance, verbal art, and oral literature lend themselves to spontaneous adaptation and to oblique expression of ideas and opinions whose utterance would otherwise be censorable or disruptive. In particular we will be concerned with the way traditional performance practices are affected by and respond to the consequences of modernization.\n\nTopics include oral epic performance, sacred narrative, Koranic chant performance, the folktale, solo performance, cultural production and resistance.\n\nAlbum image by Prof. Susan Slyomovics.\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA",

        "description": "1981 yılının muhtelif aylarında doğmuş, Milli Eğitim'in çeşitli aşamalarının travmatik (Evet, tramva değil, tramvaya girdi demek, bir ulaşım aracına başarıyla bedenini yerleştirdi demek) bir şekilde geçilmesinin ardından ODTÜ amfisinde buluşmuş iki genç irisiyiz. 30'larımızın ortasına doğru ilerlerken hala üniversite birinci sınıftaki heyecanımızı koruyoruz. Evli ve hiç çocuk babasıyız.\n\nBu programa başlarkenki amacımız, çok para verdiğimiz yarı profesyonel mikrofonlarımızın bir nebze de olsa masrafını çıkarmaktı..Evet, neredeyse 6 kiloluk bu dev mikrofonları, cücük kadar bilgisayarlarımıza taktığımızda bir şeylerin yanlış olduğunu anlamıştık. Ancak geri iade tarihi çoktan geçtiği için yapacak tek şey kalıyordu: Programı başlatmak..\n\nBu podcastin amacı aslen gündelik, kahve muhabbeti diye örselenen birçok soruya, yine kahve muhabbeti tarzında, ama bilimsel dayanaklarla cevaplar aramak. 15 dakikalık bu sohbetleri, psikoloji doktorası sahibi bir taksicinin taksisindeki bir seyahat gibi düşünebilirsiniz. İki semt arası mesafe süresinde birlikte hoşça sohbet edeceğiz ve en güzeli de hiç yorulmamış olacağız.\n\nSizden ailenize, arkadaşlarınıza, işinize ya da dersinize ayırdığınız vakitten fedakarlık etmenizi beklemiyoruz, istemiyoruz da..Televizyon denen o zaman hırsızından bizim için ve kendiniz için bir 15 dakika \"çalmanızı\" istiyoruz..Çaldıkça hoşunuza giderse, belki süreyi bile uzatabilir, yeni ekipmanlar alabilir ve çoluğun çocuğun rızkını bu uğurda çarçur edebiliriz..\n\nO yüzden bizi sevin, ama çok da değil..",

Every day, evidence generated by J-PAL researchers is influencing policy and improving lives, sometimes very directly-for example through the scale-up of effective programs-but also in less direct but equally important ways.\n\nTo date, our evidence has helped improve the lives of at least 30 million people around the world through the scale-up of highly effective policies and programs.

        "description": "Whilst international corporations are taken to court for complicity in human\nrights abuses and the trade in child labour and sweatshops is still a scourge throughout the world, this event asks whether the international approach to corporate social responsibility of the last ten years has worked.\n\nThe approach of the last decade has focused primarily on voluntary measures taken by companies and enterprises, and finds expression in codes of conduct and non-binding agreements like the UN Global Compact. The CSR movement originally proposed some measures which should be legally binding on corporations, together with voluntary measures, but this was rejected for a voluntarist approach.\n\nTen years on we can ask: has this worked?",

Sometimes, they have questions that they feel weird about asking, especially in front of people. Did you ever wonder what happens when someone dies? Logistically, spiritually, ritually, physically, financially…? Do you have weird questions that you were too embarrassed to ask? Wonder no more! Email me your questions (hello@muchadoaboutdeath.com)! In every episode, I will delve into listener questions and I'm not an expert, but if I don’t personally have the answer, I will get it from one of my funeral director friends! I will also unpack death related subjects in movies, television and in other forms of media.\nMusic by: Kai Engel (http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Kai_Engel/)\nArtwork by: Talia Pasquill",
