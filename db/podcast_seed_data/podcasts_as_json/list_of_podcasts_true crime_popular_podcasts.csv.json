The murder was quickly ruled a “car burglary gone wrong” and pinned on a low-level drug dealer named Frank Gable, a man who Francke's own brother, Kevin, along with storied Oregon reporter Phil Stanford, believe has been wrongfully imprisoned for nearly 30 years. They contend Francke had uncovered a trail of corruption in the prison system— one that led to the top of Oregon’s political establishment. Murder In Oregon follows the two men on a decades-long journey, bordering on obsession, into Oregon’s drug and crime-infested underworld to answer one question: Who really killed Michael Francke?",

        "description": "When Elizabeth Short, also known as The Black Dahlia, was brutally killed in 1947, it gripped the entire country. More than 70 years later, it remains America's most infamous unsolved murder. Many believe Dr. George Hodel was the killer, thanks to an investigation by Hodel's own son. But murder is just part of the Hodel family story, one filled with horrifying secrets that ripple across generations.  Now, through never-before-heard archival audio and first-time interviews, the Hodel family opens up to reveal their shocking story.  In this eight-part documentary series, sisters Rasha Pecoraro and Yvette Gentile, the great grand daughters of George Hodel, take a deep dive into their family history to try to figure out what really happened, and where do they all go from here? Root of Evil is the companion podcast to TNTs limited series I Am the Night. Inspired by the true story of the Hodel family, the series stars Chris Pine and comes from acclaimed Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins.",

On February 26, 2014, Christian Andreacchio was found dead in the upstairs bathroom of his apartment from a single gunshot wound to the head.

        "description": "Welcome signs proclaim it “America’s Most Beautiful Small Town.”  It’s considered the Bourbon Capital of the World.  And in many ways, Bardstown, Kentucky is just like a lot of small, tight-knit communities all across the country. But just under the surface, there’s something darker. Not everyone wants to talk about it. And a lot of people would rather forget. That’s because since 2013, Bardstown has also been the site of five unsolved murders. Now, the team behind “Bomber,” “True Crime Chronicles,” and “88 Days” is digging into these cases to find out what’s really happening in Bardstown, and whether these murders could be related. And along the way uncovering a history of violence and fear in this otherwise quintessential southern town. Bardstown launches August 28.",

        "description": "Hollywood and Crime is a ground-breaking true crime series about the most infamous murders in Tinseltown history.\n In The Black Dahlia Serial Killers, host Tracy Pattin investigates the sensational unsolved murder of Elizabeth Short. Known as the Black Dahlia, Short was a star-struck young woman whose body was found completely severed at the waist in January 1947. Many remember her tragic story, yet few know that more than a dozen other women died in similar circumstances around that same time.\n In Young Charlie, internationally acclaimed actor Stephen Lang (Avatar, Don’t Breathe) joins Tracy for the story behind the making of mass murderer, Charles Manson. Young Charlie takes us on a unique journey, investigating Manson’s unlikely path from his troubled childhood in rural West Virginia to the night in August 1969 when he sent his followers out to commit the most notorious crime in Hollywood history.\nYou can also find The Wonderland Murders here, Tracy and writer/director Larry Brand (Halloween Resurrection, The Drifter) journey back to 1981 – when four people were brutally murdered in their home in the Hollywood Hills. The Wonderland Murders is the tale of a violent home invasion robbery and the revenge rampage that followed. It involves a drug-fueled gang of criminals, a crazed crime kingpin -- and the world’s most famous porn star on a downward and deadly spiral. ",

On Jen’s Facebook page, it looked as if they were the perfect blended family, even earning the nickname “Hart Tribe” from friends. Then, on March 26, 2018, the family’s GMC Yukon was found belly-up on the rocks below California’s Highway 1. The news of the murder-suicide shocked their friends and made national headlines, leaving many wondering what possibly led to the fatal crash. Could these lives have been saved? \n\nBroken Harts, a new podcast from Glamour and HowStuffWorks, investigates this question with more than 30 never-before-heard interviews. Cohosts and Glamour editors Justine Harman and Elisabeth Egan and reporter Lauren Smiley follow the family’s journey from South Dakota through Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington, and finally to that 100-foot cliff in California.",

Christa's trash collector, Christopher McCowen, would eventually be convicted of the crime, but his trial would raise questions about the evidence, investigative methods, and whether racial prejudice played a role. Now, ABC Radio and \"20/20\" take a look at all the evidence and for the first time ever, hear directly from Christopher McCowen, to examine whether the right man is behind bars.",

        "description": "In 1983, Paladin Press, a fringe publisher, released a book called Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors. The author, who went by the pen name Rex Feral, offered very specific tips for the aspiring contract killer— where to find employment, how much to charge...and how to get away with murder. Ten years later, Tiffani Horn’s mother, 8-year-old brother, and a close family friend were found murdered. The exhaustive investigation involved multi-state surveillance and wiretaps, but it wasn’t until detectives stumbled upon Hit Man that they suddenly had what they called a blueprint for the murders. Hosted by journalist Jasmyn Morris.",

Erin will take you inside the house and you’ll spend the night where Lizzie Borden is famously accused of killing two people with an ax.\n This six-part series is as varied and diverse as Moriarty's award-winning work on 48 Hours. Was there foul play, or was it an accident the night Natalie Wood died? Take a peek behind prison walls at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, New York's maximum-security prison for women. You’ll listen not only to their stories, but to the music class that helps these violent criminals escape, at least temporarily. And Erin has her own, personal true crime journey to share when she introduces us to a young, aspiring Hollywood horror writer and producer, who just happens to be her son.",

Listen as we follow “the world’s greatest detectives” to three crime scenes—some you may know, some you don’t. In the woods of Upper Manhattan, a grisly discovery in a cooler leads detectives down a twisting path, as they attempt to solve a gut-wrenching mystery spanning decades. In South Brooklyn, police find severed limbs and a torso strewn across a rocky beach, with little to identify them. At the peak of the crack epidemic, an NYPD raid on a Bronx apartment leads to six cops shot, a suspect on the run, hostages taken, and a feverish media circus. In conjunction with the New York City Police Foundation, Break in the Case provides an extraordinary inside look at NYPD investigations and the men and women who conduct them.",

        "description": "“Chillingworth” recounts the lurid saga of the men behind the most notorious crime in Florida’s history: the grisly 1955 murder of a brilliant judge revered as an icon of integrity. Each of the three killers was horrifying enough on his own, but once they crossed racial lines to form an integrated criminal alliance, the state would never be the same. Their viciousness shook the faith Floridians had in their criminal justice system, the only institution they could trust to keep them safe. The ten-episode podcast uncovers mesmerizing surveillance audio tapes that broke the case open, unheard in over half a century. “Chillingworth” is the first story in the captivating series, \"Worst of Men\". ",

The State’s case was based almost entirely on circumstantial evidence, and no forensic evidence was found at the alleged crime scene. Melanie proclaims her innocence to this day, but nearly out of options in the courts, she shares her version of events and appeal directly to the public for help. With Melanie’s full cooperation, two Criminologists (Dr. Meghan Sacks, and Dr. Amy Shlosberg) will examine the evidence, consult independent experts and explore over 50 hours of exclusive interviews with Melanie (from prison), her family, her friends, witnesses and experts on both sides of the trial looking to uncover the whole truth about this murder.",

Theo's from Brussels. He's 18 and on a backpacking holiday when he vanishes in May 2019. Behind the scenes local volunteers who've never met Theo begin searching and investigating with his family, parallel to a major police investigation.\nAt the request of Theo's family, The Australian newspaper's national crime correspondent David Murray joins the unofficial search party to investigate the mysterious disappearance for a new podcast series, The Lighthouse. Theo left a local bar around 11pm. As the search narrows to the area around the 118-year-old Cape Byron Lighthouse, a range of theories emerge.\nFrom the newspaper that brought you The Teacher's Pet and Who The Hell is Hamish, The Lighthouse investigates all possible scenarios as it takes you inside an extraordinary search.\nTo read more about the disappearance of Theo Hayez, and access exclusive photos and video material, go to www.lighthousepodcast.com.au.",

Death would soon creep into the charming community he would come to terrorize. The bodies of his victims - kept a mere few feet from where his mother slept would prove to become his undoing. Ten years after the murders, Seduced by Satan delves into the twisted soul of a man who called himself Pazuzu.",

For example; Episode 1 examines two notorious murderers whose names begin with the letter A.  Season 2 we will go down the alphabet focusing on different serial killers/spree killers/murderers who were from or committed most of their crimes in cities/towns with each respective letter of the alphabet.  For example, we may focus on someone from Cincinnati, Ohio for the letter C.  Every episode is different and every episode is entertaining!  We will delve into whether we think nature made the criminals commit these heinous acts, or if it's simply their narcissism getting the best of them.  Keep in mind, this podcast is strictly for entertainment purposes and is in no way a professional diagnosis of the subjects discussed.",
