This hour will feel like you're hanging with your best girl friends. Lynette and Stefanie are honest, silly and sometimes become vulnerable as they discuss their own experiences as wife and mom.

The story centers on Finn Caspian, an 8-year-old boy aboard The Famous Marlowe 280 Interplanetary Exploratory Space Station. He and his friends Abigail, Elias and Vale are Explorers Troop 301, taking off from the Marlowe to explore uncharted planets, help the occasional alien, and solve a mystery that threatens to destroy the Marlowe. When pressed, we describe it as a \"mystery gang\" story, sort of like Scooby-Doo in space.\n\nThe story is written and performed by Jonathan Messinger, author of Hiding Out, former web editor of Time Out Chicago Kids, and father of two boys. His son Griffin, 7, serves as editor of the story, appearing in episodes to critique, make predictions and express skepticism that his father knows what he's talking about, which also happens to be the way the rest of their relationship works.",

As originally created by author Jack Boyle, he was a safecracker, a hardened criminal who had served time in a California prison. Prowling the underworld as a detective in adaptations for films, radio and television, the detective Boston Blackie was \"an enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.\"\nThe Boston Blackie radio series, starring Chester Morris, began June 23, 1944, on NBC as a summer replacement for The Amos 'n' Andy Show. Sponsored by Rinso, the series continued until September 15 of that year. Lesley Woods appeared as Blackie's girlfriend Mary Wesley, and Harlow Wilcox was the show's announcer.\n\nOn April 11, 1945, Richard Kollmar took over the title role in a radio series syndicated by Frederic W. Ziv to Mutual and other network outlets. Over 200 episodes of this series were produced between 1944 and October 25, 1950. Other sponsors included Lifebuoy Soap, Champagne Velvet beer and R&H beer.",

        "description": "X Minus One is widely considered among the finest science fiction dramas ever produced for radio. The first 15 episodes were new versions of Dimension X episodes, but the remainder were adaptations of newly published science fiction stories by leading writers in the field, including Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Philip K. Dick, Robert A. Heinlein, Frederik Pohl and Theodore Sturgeon, along with a few original scripts. For baby boomer's that liked The Outer Limits and The Twilight Zone and for all you Trekkies, X Minus One is the forefather of the science fiction you grew up with. You will find that it still is some of the best Science Fiction ever aired. Regardless of you age join us as we explore science fiction with the imagination of our minds and great story telling.",

Jack Benny (February 14, 1894 in Chicago, Illinois â December 26, 1974 in Beverly Hills, California), born Benjamin Kubelsky, was an American comedian, vaudeville performer, and radio, television, and film actor. He was one of the biggest stars in classic American radio and was also a major television personality. Benny was renowned for his flawless comic timing and (especially) his ability to get laughs with either a pregnant pause or a single expression, such as his signature exasperated \"Well!\". In hand with his dear friend and great \"rival\" Fred Allen â their long-running \"feud\" was a famous running gag. Now join us as we return to The Jack Benny Program \nfilled with laughter and great gags that will keep you coming back for more.",

        "description": "Minimal-ish is a podcast about minimalism...sort of. It's the podcast that encourages you to let go of material things and clear out your space to make room for what matters. Believe it or not, your stuff takes up your time, and cluttered spaces can be a source of anxiousness. Fill your life with the people and things that you love, and get rid of the rest. Through conversations with other women and moms on the same simple-living journey, the Minimal-ish podcast will encourage you towards the grace-filled, realistic form of minimalism that benefits your life and family most. \n\nBut it's not just about getting rid of your stuff or tidying up your home. There's so much more. Minimalism allows you to make room to live the life you want. This podcast discusses how to live the intentional life you want to live through simplifying in every area- how to make room so you can tell the story you want to tell with the life you've been given. \n\nYour host, Desirae Endres, is a stay at home/ work at home mom, teacher, and writer that believes that minimalism and having an uncluttered home environment can benefit everyone, but it doesn't look the same for everyone. Minimalism has changed her life, and if she can make minimalism attainable and sustainable in her life, anyone can. She brings honesty and transparency to the conversation as an admittedly (formerly-ish) unorganized, messy and anxious person as she discusses topics of minimalism, intentional, creative  living, motherhood, and more.  \n\nGrab a cup of coffee & listen in!",

As originally created by author Jack Boyle, he was a safecracker, a hardened criminal who had served time in a California prison. Prowling the underworld as a detective in adaptations for films, radio and television, the detective Boston Blackie was \"an enemy to those who make him an enemy, friend to those who have no friend.\"\nThe Boston Blackie radio series, starring Chester Morris, began June 23, 1944, on NBC as a summer replacement for The Amos 'n' Andy Show. Sponsored by Rinso, the series continued until September 15 of that year. Lesley Woods appeared as Blackie's girlfriend Mary Wesley, and Harlow Wilcox was the show's announcer.\n\nOn April 11, 1945, Richard Kollmar took over the title role in a radio series syndicated by Frederic W.

        "description": "Hosted by funny moms Margaret Ables (Nick Mom) and Amy Wilson (When Did I Get Like This?), “What Fresh Hell: Laughing in the Face of Motherhood” is a comedy podcast solving today’s parenting dilemmas so you don’t have to. We’re both moms of three, dealing with the same hassles as any parent, albeit with slightly differing styles. Margaret is laid-back to the max; Amy never met an expert or a list she didn't like. In each episode, we discuss a parenting issue from multiple perspectives and the accompanying expert advice that may or may not back us up. We talk about it, laugh about it, call out each other’s nonsense, and then we come up with concrete solutions. Join us as we laugh in the face of motherhood! Winner of the 2018 Mom 2.0 Iris Award for Best Podcast, the 2017 Podcast Awards People’s Choice for Best Family and Parenting Podcast, and finalist for the 2019 Romper's Parent's Choice Award. whatfreshhellpodcast.com",

Many pregnant women credit the podcast with helping them have a positive birth. \n\n\n\nThe show is a mix of real life positive birth stories, birthing experts sharing their wisdom and Alexia sharing how to get into a positive birthing mindset, including techniques for releasing fears. \n\n\n\nAlexia is a therapeutic coach, speaker, trainer and author of the book “Fearless Birthing: Clear Your Fears For a Positive Birth”. The podcast, which began as a maternity leave side project, is now an essential resource for women with a fear of birth with tens of thousands of expectant mamas now listening to Alexia’s podcast each month to lose The Fear and prepare for birth.  \n\n\n\nIt all started when Alexia experienced her first miscarriage and felt relief; she knew something was amiss. She had tokophobia, the extreme fear of pregnancy and birth, which is pretty terrifying. Alexia used her superpowers to overcome it and have two amazing births, and she now helps other women all around the world to do the same from her home in the middle of England. \n\nFear Free Childbirth is the online destination for women seeking to take the fear out of birth with fear-clearance meditations, online fear-clearance courses and programs for overcoming tokophobia.

        "description": "Connected Parenting shares techniques that therapists use to help parents soothe their child as well as enhance the parent-child bond and is based on the understanding that correcting and guiding behavior works best when it is preceded by and linked to empathy. At the heart of this parenting model is the CALM Technique which helps parents accurately attune to children’s affect and experience. These empathic interactions release reward chemicals in the brain that stimulate positive emotions and increase order and balance in the nervous system. Reward chemicals, including natural opiates, endorphins, and a powerful hormone called oxytocin, reduce and inhibit stress hormones and bathe the brain in positive emotions that ripple through every cell in the body. The benefits of empathy and compassion have a strong base in science that cannot be underestimated. Simply put, it is brain food, the emotional nutrition all of us need, perhaps our children most of all.\n\nAlthough many parenting techniques stress the importance of empathy, Connected Parenting will show you how to use it skillfully to repair frayed bonds, deescalate tantrums, contain and correct difficult behaviors and help your child to become more confident and emotionally resilient. We use a collaborative and supportive coaching model and provide inspirational, easy-to-understand techniques grounded in neuroscience and attachment. In the end, your child will be more compliant, more relaxed, and – most importantly – happier. Connected Parenting will bring out the best in you and your child.",

We talk about having sex while pregnant and maintaining your connection and intimacy as a couple. We reveal how to stay centered and not lose yourself through pregnancy, and tons more!

        "description": "Montgomery’s literary classic recounts the exciting adventures undertaken by the fiery eleven-year-old Anne Shirley, an orphan girl accidentally adopted by middle aged siblings Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert. A coming-of-age novel, Anne of Green Gables focuses on Anne’s new life at Green Gables farm in Avonlea and her adjustment into the Prince Edward Island community. \n \nThe story launches when the aging siblings Matthew and Marilla decide that they could use an extra hand around their farm, and believe that adopting an orphan boy would be an appropriate solution.  However, due to a misunderstanding, the orphanage sends Anne Shirley instead.  As Matthew heads to the train station to pick up the anticipated boy, he is shocked to be greeted by a red-headed, freckled and quite talkative little girl. Oblivious to the fact that a mistake has been made, Anne cheerfully enjoys the ride to her new home not hiding her enthusiasm whatsoever. Although initially spinster Marilla requires a bit of persuasion, both siblings are drawn in by the irresistible charms of the young chatty girl and accept the orphanage’s mix-up. Undeniably Anne adds the much needed color in the lives of Matthew and Marilla who are quiet and timid, while Anne serves as a complete opposite to the two. As Anne adjusts to her new surroundings, she leaves readers absorbed as she makes social gaffes in her clumsy attempts to soak in the social norms, religion, and morals with which her peers are already long accustomed to. Obstructed by countless mischief and creative excursions, Anne must make a distinction between reality and imagination as she walks along the path of self-expression. \n\t\nA timeless favorite, Anne of Green Gables leaves a mark on all that have come across the bright and imaginative character portrayed by Anne.  It is nevertheless a little girl’s imagination, romanticism, free-spirit and playful antics that have presented Montgomery’s novel with a special place in the world of literature. \n\nAll books in this series:1 Anne of Green Gables2 Anne of Avonlea3 Anne of the Island5 Anne’s House of Dreams7 Rainbow Valley8 Rilla of Ingleside",

        "description": "Set in nineteenth century New England, Little Women follows the lives of the four March sisters-Jo, Beth, Amy and Meg. The novel is a classic rites of passage story, that has often split literature critics but has been adored by many over the years. Intended as a book for young girls, the book is too sentimental for some but plenty of adults and young men have Little Women firmly featured in their best books of all time. The pace of the novel can be slow at times and the language almost too perfect but the overall sympathetic tone of Alcott wins over the reader.\n\nThe book is semi-autobiographical, with Jo Marsh mirroring the life of an ambitious Alcott. Just like Alcott, Jo is a strong, independent woman who is fighting through her domestic duties to do what she truly loves. Writing is Jo’s passion and in a world where women are expected to put personal growth aside in order to withhold traditional family values, she is met with many challenges. \n\n“I am not afraid of storms, for I am learning how to sail my ship.” \n\nThe book speaks to every woman that has had to fight against convention. With their father away at war, the four sisters pull together to support each other but still have time to search for their own identity. These ‘little women’ are not children but young adults finding their way via love, religion and confidence. Whilst it may seem sad that the sisters do have to conform to some extent, if you read between the lines there is so much inspiration for young female readers.",

        "description": "Dad and Buried is a podcast about parenting from a couple of guys who hate parenting. Don't get them wrong, they love their kids - to different degrees, depending on the day (and the kid) - but being a parent is tough, time-consuming, stressful, thankless, expensive, exhausting, largely unrewarding, really loud, often quite boring - did I say expensive yet?,or thankless? - emotionally draining work. Join Mike and Pete as they mock children, bash parenting, and talk about the stuff that most parents don't usually talk about. At least not out loud.\n\nSupport: https://www.patreon.com/Dadandburied Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/dadandburied/support",
