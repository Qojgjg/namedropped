        "description": "The iFanboy.com Comic Book Podcast is a weekly talk show discussing the best in current comic books. Ron, Conor and Josh will share what they loved and hated about the week's comics. With a deep, sometimes scary knowledge of the depths and intricacies of pop culture and the geek lifestyle, the conversations can spin off in many directions. While comics, graphic novels and trade paperbacks are the center of the iFanboy universe, the discussion often covers the video games, movies and TV shows which will capture the fancy of your regular comic book reader. Fun, intelligent, witty and entertaining, the iFanboy crew are just as likely to agree as argue about what's good and what's bad in superhero comics, indie comics, humorous comics, and important graphic novels as well as the creators, writers and artists behind them.  We've even occasionally been in the same room as guys like Brian Michael Bendis, Darwyn Cooke, Kurt Busiek, Warren Ellis, Jim Lee, Joe Quesada, Steve Dillon, Kevin Smith, Stan Lee and others.  It was a big room, but we were in it. This podcast is so good, you don't even need to read comic books to enjoy it, but it's a lot better if you do.",

More than that, it is the visual expression of culture, politics, society, religion, emotion, zeitgeist, channelled through the brush, chisel, or hands of creative individuals. Understanding art allows us to understand history: to pin it with images, and pepper it with the faces, colours, drama and expression of its time. This series is designed to give bite-sized insights into the world of Art History, bringing one image to life across 20 minutes through discussion with experts. History is never far from view, so each image will be expanded to sit within the cultural and historical context that produced it. Presented by Dr Janina Ramirez Produced by Dan Morelle",

        "description": "Art Grind is a podcast for and about artists, art lovers and art professionals. It is a social practice of giving back to the art community of which we are a part and explores the process, content, concept and motivation behind art making of both established and emerging artists and the people who bring that art to a wider audience. We are artists ourselves and wear many hats, including curation, art writing and art teaching. We share a passion for authentic and skilled art making, be it trained or self-taught. Whether in the studio, on your lunch hour or chilling out after a long day of hustle, have a listen while we explore, along with our guests, the backstories of what we fondly call “the art grind”.",

Sergio Lopez is an artist who studied at art college, and Joshua Lawyer is self-taught. But both of them have a lot to say about being professional artists. This show isn't about what brushes to use or how to sell your paintings. They talk to artists and each other about what's going on in their lives and try to make each other laugh, and sometimes learn a thing or two in the process.",

        "description": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle thought he had finished forever with his immortal sleuth Sherlock Holmes and his chronicler, Dr Watson. Exhausted and bored with the Holmes saga, he wanted to turn to more serious writing.  In the short story The Final Problem, published in 1893 as part of the  collection The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, the author had sent Holmes plunging to his doom into the Reichenbach Falls. However, by 1901, Doyle found himself in severe financial difficulties. It was then that he resurrected his popular detective. The Hound of the Baskervilles is set in time before the Reichenbach and as the publishers had predicted, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle once again struck gold! \n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles is thrilling, tightly-plotted and full of atmosphere. Set in the misty and sinister landscape of Dartmoor, it was inspired by the true story of a wicked 17th century Squire who lived in the West Country. Tales of the man's villainous ways were whispered about and when he finally died, his evil spirit continued to roam the moors, leading a pack of supernatural hounds who were often seen at his tomb!\n\nIn the novel, Sir James Mortimer, a physician and friend of the Baskervilles, a noble country family consults Holmes in London and seeks his help. Sir Charles Baskerville, the owner of a mansion called Baskerville Hall has been found dead under mysterious circumstances, which lead Sir James to fear that he was the victim of a strange and fatal family curse. A remote ancestor, notorious for his debauched ways, had been violently killed by a hell-hound with supernatural powers. People in the neighboring village report having seen an enormous hound on the moors at night. Mortimer now fears that Sir Charles has been visited by this terrible creature whose mission is to destroy the Baskerville family. \n\nThe heir to the estate, Sir Henry Baskerville, is on his way home from Canada to claim his inheritance. Mortimer is apprehensive that Sir Henry will be the next target of this terrible creature. Holmes and Watson set out for Baskerville Hall. As he remarks, “The game's afoot!” \n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles is a masterpiece of chilling detective fiction. It has been extensively adapted for radio, film and television all over the world. The story has lent its name to a psycho-medical condition called the Baskerville Effect – heart ailments caused by psychological stress! In all, a great read for that cold and rainy night!",

Through an on-going series of in-depth and revealing conversations with art selling masters from every strata, angle and specialty this podcast aims to capture an industry that remains a mystery to even those who are at its center. \n\n\n\nIt’s our opportunity to share the wisdom and stories that don’t usually travel past the walls of galleries around the world and which could potentially be lost forever. These are are the tales and biographies that define our chosen field through its history and culture. \n\n\n\nSo my art-selling friend, order something stiff from the bar, pull up a seat and please join us.\n\n\n\nCheers.",
