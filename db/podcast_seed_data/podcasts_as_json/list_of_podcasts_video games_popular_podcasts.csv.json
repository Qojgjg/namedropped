        "description": "Watch Out for Fireballs! is a game club podcast, focused on retro and non-current games. Every week, we play a game in its entirety, then discuss its merits and flaws at length. Most episodes begin with a short sketch, and we're pretty liberal about keeping tangents in. But it ultimately comes down to: Why do we like (or dislike?) this game.",

Live every Tuesday, VGO is home to a unique community who participates in the shows via listener voicemail (call 1-520-FEEL-VGO), the IRC chat room, and their often totally worthless tweets.

Over the decades they’ve evolved from simplistic monaural beeps and bloops to full orchestral scores recorded in 7.1 surround, but from their earliest days right up to today, soundtracks have played an integral part of our memories of the games we played, and the times in our lives when we were playing them.\n\n\n\nWhat we aim to bring you with Sound of Play is a diverse sample of our favourites pieces from the many air-punching, spine-tingling, tear-jerking and grin-inducing videogame soundtracks we’ve heard over the years.",

We like to keep things on the lighter side, but with years of journalistic experience under our belts, it allows for in-depth analysis and perspectives. Here you will hear us review some of the greatest games ever made, from the NES, SNES, Gameboy and the N64 up to the Gamecube, Wii, WiiU and Nintendo Switch. There's also a sprinkle of news each week and the occasional interview with indie developers across the globe. Hosted by Ricky D, Tim Maison, and Patrick Murphy, the show has gained a huge following since it debuted in 2015 at the now defunct e-zine, Sound On Sight. It has since gone on to be nominated one of the ten best gaming podcasts worldwide and is featured on iTunes, Google Play, Stitcher, Radio Public, Radio FM and of course on GoombaStomp.com.",
