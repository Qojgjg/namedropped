        "description": "Tom and Dan were once sitting in a hotel room in Daytona Beach, Florida where the air-condition didn't work, they were out of beer, and the cable only had 2 channels that came in static free. One of their friends suggested that they leave and attempt to find something better to do to which Dan replied \"Why would we want to ruin a mediocre time?\"\n\nIf you were to ask \"Tom and Dan\" what the meaning of life is, they might tell you that there is none. Born from a feeling that nothing in life truly matters and that for the most part we're all surrounded by scumbags, \"Tom and Dan\" figured out that there's only one true constant in life; laughter. How did they come to that conclusion? It's all they have. You see, just like the mass majority of us, \"T & D\" have day jobs and it was at said day job where they cued in on the fact that some of the greatest laughs came at the end of the day. There's just something about the relaxed feeling of knowing that you have very little time left at work to put in. Maybe it's the \"punch drunkenness\" of still being at work; no one is quite sure. There they sat in their office, the door shut to their co-workers and management, only making each other laugh to the point of tears. Finally they realized that it might not be such a bad idea to roll tape on these conversations. Why not? They would be having them anyway, taped or not, and it was fun. Both of them come from rather lengthy broadcasting careers so setting up a home studio wasn't so hard to do. And with the addition of Ross, the consummate straight man and \"News Dad\", things got even more \"mediocre.\" Broadcasting since 2009 has garnered a rather extensive following for \"T & D\" with loyal \"scumbags\" (as their listeners are affectionately known) checking in from all across the world. Hundreds of shows under their belts and winners of the Orlando Weekly's \"Best of Orlando 2011\" for \"Best Kept Secret\" reassures them both that yes…no one is listening! (Best Kept Secret? HA!)",

        "description": "Hi. My name is Jason Newland. I am a Hypnotist, Counsellor & NLP Master Practitioner. I’m also a proud Daddy to a little Ferret, called Andre. I have been providing this FREE Hypnosis Service, Online, since 2006. I have made hundreds of hypnosis videos & recorded over a thousand mp3 downloads. Everything I do is free for all to download and stream.\n\nThis particular, “Let me bore you to sleep” podcast, has been running since January 2018. Each session is different, yet similar in the sense that its all aimed at helping you to relax your body, calm & slow down your mind and drift off into a natural, healing & safe sleep. I tell silly stories, talk about boring events in my life and just mess around. It’s not supposed to be taken seriously, but really can relax your body and mind and bore you into a lovely, peaceful sleep.\n\nSome people tell me that they listen to this podcast for company. They like the fact that I make regular recordings and talk about my life, as well as making up stuff. Sometimes its just really nice to hear a friendly voice once a day.\n\nSessions last approximately 1 hour each, and of course I am incredibly BORING in every one. I genuinely hope that this Boring sleep podcast helps you to overcome insomnia and sleep easier. If you need to contact me, my personal email address is: jasonnewland@hotmail.co.uk you can contact me on the contact page. Lots of love Jason Newland. xx\nMy website for this podcast is: http://letmeboreyoutosleep.com/\n\nI invite you to support this Free Hypnosis Service: https://www.paypal.me/jasonnewland",

Well, there are topics we really don’t care about, those are off limits, but everything else is game. BRBPodcast makes it a point to delve deep into the raw fleshy underbelly of this mortal coil, leaving our audience wanting more (or nothing at all). So, what does it mean to be the most underground podcast on the internet? Other than a super cool name, it means we have no ties to creepy big business or The Man, and we make no money, have no filters, and answer to no one (until we sell out). This gives us the unfiltered opportunity to share our combined wisdom (otherwise known as “The Wisdom of A 1000 Two Year Olds”) to the world in a series of ham-fisted conversation. Only the few will listen and less of those few will understand (so basically, like 1 to 5 people). Join us, every week, on our quest to dig deep into the issues, and burrow into the proverbial earth.",

They've been called ‘selfish’, ‘immature’, ‘unfulfilled’ and even ‘unAustralian’ – by their own families! Out of step with a world that exalts the traditional family unit above all else, Ian and Jennifer are also battling extinction in their workplaces – commercial radio and book publishing. \n\nContains foul language.
