We could see the gains we make in these next few years help us conserve resources and let us lead safer and healthier lives or we could open the door to a dystopian society where our every thought is monitored and our every utterance is effectively for sale.

Whether you are involved from the military, law enforcement, consulting, or IT services, it doesn’t matter. I have had countless discussions for years with other professionals online, at conferences, or over drinks, which have changed the way I think about cyber security. That is where this podcast comes in. What if I can capture those moments and frank discussions? I want to share the stories from other cyber security leaders and influencers so everyone can learn from their respective journeys and challenges. Why did they take the path they did? Who were their mentors? How did they tackle some of their biggest career challenges? By hearing how the industry leaders and influencers got to where they are and how they overcame some of the problems they faced, I hope to shed light on the path for other professionals. I will discover what motivates them, explore their journey in cyber security, and discuss where they think the industry is going.",

The goal of \"Voices from DARPA\" is to share with listeners some of the institutional know-how, vision, process, and history that together make the “secret sauce” DARPA has been adding to the Nation’s innovation ecosystem for nearly 60 years. On another level, we at DARPA just wanted to share the pleasure we all have every day—in the elevator, in the halls, in our meeting rooms—as we learn from each other and swap ideas and strive to change what’s possible.",
