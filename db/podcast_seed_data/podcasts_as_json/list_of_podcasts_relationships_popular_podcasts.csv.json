Wondery’s new series is all about love, relationships, and the sometimes bumpy road to commitment. Host Ingrid Haas (Chelsea Lately, Key and Peele) recently got engaged herself, and she will explore stories from real couples to learn what went wrong, and how they finally got it right. She’ll recount surprise engagements featuring pop stars and tense wedding ceremonies. And she’ll look for answers to the questions that keep us up at night: Will I ever find someone? If I like it, will I put a ring on it? And how the hell does anyone get to happily ever after anyway?",

But this feels like a really great place for me to sit down with some incredible, smart and interesting people that I’ve met through my work and have those meaningful conversations with.

Neither of them describe themselves as naturally positive, but they attribute this exercise with reprogramming their brain to allow them to instinctively look for the upside in any challenging situation.\n\nCallie is a talent assistant who is insightful, sensitive, and kind. Jeff is a radio personality and comedian who loves to make people laugh and usually says what everyone else is thinking. They've been married since 2016 (Callie’s first, Jeff’s second) and are working on their first human baby. (They’re already parents to two rescue dogs, Sadie and Lily.) \n\nYou're going to hear real talk about real life, and you're going to laugh ... a LOT.  The ups and downs of life. The exciting and the mundane and the embarrassing.  Pop culture and news and whatever else comes to mind. All on the table for this show ... and all with one theme:  LIVE FOR THE UPSIDE.\n\nCallie and Jeff know that sometimes, no matter how positively you want to process things, life hits you so hard that it seems impossible. That will be addressed as well, but never in a preachy, 'they've got all the answers' way.\n\n\"Everyone's journey is different. We're not going to tell you how to take yours. But we want to share some things we know that might make it easier for you,\" is how Jeff describes their show.\n\nFor more:  follow @calliedauler & @jeffdauler on Instagram.",

You will laugh, you will cry, and have your own mind BLOWN, by how POSSIBLE it will be for you to THRIVE from heartbreak, versus barely survive.   \n\nAfter years of enduring toxic relationships, and being at a loss on how to navigate through the pain, Claire is now dedicated to helping other women like her, not only STOP wanting him back, but become the best version of themselves, BECAUSE of the heartbreak. \n\nPLEASE NOTE:  Claire refers to her exes and the listener’s ex as a “he,” based on her own personal experience as a heterosexual female, but this work can be applied to ANYONE going through heartbreak.  ALL genders and sexual orientations are encouraged to listen and apply Claire’s tools into their own lives!",

Love is hard and sometimes you just need a little advice; and the best advice comes from those who shouldn’t be giving it. Amy is as pessimistic as they come, and is a true believer in “nothing lasts forever.” And Jack, is optimistic when it comes to love, believing healthy, long-lasting relationships do exist - he just hasn’t found one yet. Here to make you laugh when you’re getting over an ex, and keep you in check when you fall in love after the first date, Amy and Jack will always give it to you straight.",

If you struggle with approach anxiety, fear of women, fear of rejection, and the popular “what should I say next” syndrome, Sebastian’s daily10-minute rants about pickup and seduction will change your life. It doesn’t matter if you want a girlfriend, friends with benefits relationships, or if you want to travel the world and seduce a new breathtaking young girl every weekend. You will learn how to develop unshakable confidence and the right mindset to meet and attract beautiful women. You will learn how to become more attractive, how to approach women, how to talk to women, how to touch women, how to read a woman’s mind, how to get a woman’s phone number, how to have amazing first, second, third (and instant) dates, how to connect with women emotionally, and of course, how to pick up girls during the day (daygame) and at night (nightgame). Heck, you’ll even learn how to make a woman fall in love with you and how to get a girlfriend…and some naughty sex tips in between. If you enjoy listening to podcasts such as the Tom Torero Podcast, the Savage Lovecast, the Mountain Tip (Chick Whisperer) Podcast, the How to Talk to Girls Podcast by Tripp Advice, the Art of Charm Podcast (back when they were talking about getting laid), you will love the Global Seducer Quickie.  Just click the subscribe button and listen to my free podcast! You’ll either hate it or love it. Well, what can I say? The path towards becoming a Global Seducer is only for a selected few…Do you want me as a guest on your podcast? Shoot me an email: sebastian@globalseducer.com",

Understand the ways, whys, and hows that verbal abuse, emotional abuse, and spiritual abuse affect you over time. Whether the Hijackal is a partner, parent, ex, or colleague, what you will learn here will strengthen and empower you to step up, speak up, and stand up for yourself in healthy, assertive ways. Many Hijackals have behaviors that are consider the same as those who are diagnoses as narcissists, borderlines, psychopaths, sociopaths, and histrionic personality disorder.\nThese insights will help you to make the changes--and good decisions--to move from pain to power, and that's exactly what you want to do!

        "description": "Men like you submit questions on dating & sex, then I ask a group of women to answer them. As a moderator and a guy, I help them answer in ways men understand. Also, I keep them focused on positive feedback (what they like and want us to do more of), not negative (what they hate that we do).\n\nDating podcasts for men like us tend to be negative feedback from women (\"stop ghosting!\" \"don't be too aggressive!\"), or just pick-up artists. Neither are helpful, because dating and sex are about building empathy and connection. So guiding the group of women to focus on positive feedback, and particularly to tell you what they like, is much more helpful. And more fun, too!\n\nWhat would you like to have answered? Please send me your questions, I'd love to get them answered!  http://www.debugdating.com/questions",

But I HAVE been on more dates than my therapist and probably most of you, so I think it's safe to say, I have what people like to call, “real world experience,”  which makes my content relevant and applicable to your dating lives.  Some of these stories will shock you. Some might even be a little tactless and tasteless at times. That's ok.  My intention is never to be mean spirited. I just prefer to look at the world with a bit of levity and a ton of laughter.   With equal parts vulgarity and vulnerability, I give you a podcast about truly horrible dates.

It's a frank discussion, from almost 30 years of marriage experience and more than general rhetoric conversation. It's relatable experiences from the viewpoint of a man and woman, in their own humorous way, who committed to the institution of marriage at the young age of 21. Their episodes will help you get a true understanding of how you and your significant other can stay bonded in matrimony for decades and maybe even into the golden years. As troubled times arise in any marriage, these co-authors offer a guideline on how to apply a little duct tape and keep the wheels of happiness moving.",

Understand the ways, whys, and hows that verbal abuse, emotional abuse, and spiritual abuse affect you over time. Whether the Hijackal is a partner, parent, ex, or colleague, what you will learn here will strengthen and empower you to step up, speak up, and stand up for yourself in healthy, assertive ways. Many Hijackals have behaviors that are consider the same as those who are diagnoses as narcissists, borderlines, psychopaths, sociopaths, and histrionic personality disorder.\nThese insights will help you to make the changes--and good decisions--to move from pain to power, and that's exactly what you want to do!

Both she and her co-host, psychotherapist Jane Prelinger, have been through divorce themselves- both as children and as adults. So they know, first-hand, that divorce is more painful and destabilizing, even, than most people imagine. In this podcast Kate and Jane offer compassionate, common-sense, practical and never-preachy advice on even the toughest divorce topics. Their message? Divorce (and parenting during divorce) is tough, and you're only  human. But with the right blend of support, advice and hard work, you can learn to navigate it so that you (and your kids, if you have them) can move through this transition whole, happy, and ready to get on with the rest of your life.",
