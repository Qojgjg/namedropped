Everyone is welcome to listen and comment! Listeners do not need a copy of the issue, or even a passing knowledge of the X-Men to enjoy, as the Danger Room duo tell each story so that anyone can follow along!

Now we need to learn to value bees for their own sake - for their part in nature as pollinators of many plant species, both wild and cultivated. \n\nThe Barefoot Beekeeper is available in print or as an ebook from www.biobees.com",

When most of us think \"draft beverage\", beer is the first thing that comes to mind. We're here to discuss the wide variety of craft beverages that can be served on draft. Whether that be beer, soda, tea, sparkling water, kombucha or coffee. There are many ways to make and serve craft beverages on draft and we're here to discuss them all. The craft beer industry is booming - Did you know that you can easily serve your favorite craft beer on draft at home? We'll discuss the equipment necessary to get a keg of your favorite craft beer pouring on draft in the comfort of your own home. The coffee industry is changing - Have you ever tried cold brewed coffee on draft? Coffee shops and restaurants all over the country are starting to serve cold brewed coffee on draft, and to take it even one step further, many shops are now serving \"nitro coffee\". Nitro coffee is cold brewed coffee that has been infused with nitrogen and is poured on draft out of a stout faucet. This process gives it the same rich, frothy, cascading pour that you’ve likely seen in a pint of Guinness. Want to learn how to take your coffee to the next level? We'll show you how! Want to learn how to make and serve naturally flavored sparkling water? We'll show you how. Whether you're a small business owner, a craft beverage lover or maybe just a tinkerer, there will be something for you on the Drips & Draughts Podcast. You may also be search for Drips and Drafts, Drips & Drafts, but we spell it Drips & Draughts because we're fancy.",

A few years later, I learned to knit by watching video tutorials. Next, I took my first spinning class and purchased a Louet. When my mother discovered a loom in her attic, I took it home. The setting for all of this crafting is a lovely tea house near Delaware Water Gap, PA. \nI’ve been a longtime listener of audio podcasts and I’m happy to add my contribution with Yarns at Yin Hoo, which I will release in August of 2013.",

        "description": "Back in 1982 a man named Byron Priess decided it would be a good idea to publish a treasure hunt. He spent a year or so traveling around the country, burying small ceramic boxes two feet underground. He wrote a few poems, and had a friend of his paint some images. The goal was to get the reader to match a poem with a verse, produce a treasure map of sorts, then go dig up the treasures.\nHe thought it would be easy.\n40 years later we are finding out he was wrong.\n\nSo far two treasures have been found. One in Chicago, and one in Cleveland… so at least we know they are real. That’s about all we know for sure.\n\nThis project started with Byron recruiting a bunch of his friends. Sean and Ted to write some descriptions of strange creatures that Byron’s friend JoEllen sculpted out of clay and cloth, which were photographed by his childhood friend Ben. Then Byron’s friends John Palencar, John Pierard, and Overton Loyd made a bunch of images with the sole purpose of confusing all of us.\n\nThe project was created by a community of friends, and it is my opinion that a community of friends is the only way to solve it.",

We decided one day to make a podcast where we drink heavily and discuss Fantasy Hockey tips. \n\nWe talk streamers, rankings, draft strategy, weekly adds and drops, trends, and most importantly who is hot and who is not. Literally. We talk about which hockey players are good looking way too much. It's a problem.\n\nLove you guys!\n\nYou can find us on Twitter and Instagram @FHFHockey",
