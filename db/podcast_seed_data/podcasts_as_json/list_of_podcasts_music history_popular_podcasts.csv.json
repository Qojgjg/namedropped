It all started in Miami with the 2 Live Crew, a group that took hip hop and made it faster, harder, and nastier than anything anyone had heard before. But in 1990 their music was declared legally obscene, and what followed is known today as the most controversial trial in the history of hip hop. This group, this city and this trial changed the course of music history as we know it. Mogul Season 2 features exclusive interviews with Miami legends like Trick Daddy, Rick Ross, Trina, Luke Campbell, Brother Marquis, Mr. Mixx, Walshy Fire, and more.",

He opened it with his roommate Taime Downe from the band Faster Pussycat with the premise of getting free drinks and meeting girls.\n\n    Riki enforced a no camera rule at the Cathouse so anything could and did happen.

Think of it as a college level Rock N Roll 101 course...or if you prefer, a multi-part audio documentary.\n\nWe take in the music, culture and technology of the second half of the 20th Century to prove how significant and how much impact this art movement had to the times, while still resonating today. It’s carefully researched, fully scripted and highly produced...a little bit academic in tone, because we do our homework.\n\nBut we throw in a lot of fun too: music, storytelling, commentary and quotes, lots of sound design. The series is presented in chronological order, and we take our time making these, really trying to get the history right. \n\nWe’re part of the Osiris podcast network. Osiris is creating a community that connects people like you with podcasts and live experiences about artists and topics you love.",

Buttressed with illustrative clips, Martin argues quickly and succinctly why these songs - and the specific sections of these tracks - support his mad professor premise, from the wobbly invention of an “American” heavy metal, to the influence of Led Zeppelin in hair metal or to more succinct topics like tapping and twin leads. The songs serve as bricks, but Martin slathers plenty of mortar. At the end, hopefully he has sturdy house in which this week’s theory can reside unbothered by the elements.\n\nAt approximately 7000, Martin has had published in books more record reviews than anybody in the history of music writing across all genres. Additionally, Martin has penned approximately 85 books on hard rock, heavy metal, classic rock and record collecting.",

        "description": "Подкаст «Радио Arzamas» об истории британской музыки. Почему рейвы невозможно было запретить? Откуда в советском «Шерлоке Холмсе» отголоски великого композитора эпохи барокко Генри Пёрселла? Как получилось, что скинхеды подсели на ямайские ритмы, а панки побратались с растафрианцами? Музыкальный журналист Лев Ганкин отвечает на эти и другие вопросы вместе с редакторами «Арзамаса» и приглашенными гостями. \n\nПодкаст сделан вместе с Отделом культуры и образования Посольства Великобритании в Москве и при поддержке Британского Совета.\n\nЭтот и другие подкасты «Арзамаса» удобнее всего слушать в мобильном приложении «Радио Arzamas».",

Arguably the most influential singer/songwriter of our era, Dylan has been making music, in the words of some English folk, for \"donkey's years.\"  That means a very long time.  During his long, unpredictable career, he has exhibited a fascinating relationship with religion and spirituality, one that extends far beyond his \"gospel years.\"  On this podcast, Malcolm Gold, a sociologist of religion at Messiah College and Jay Case, a professor of American religious history at Malone University, explore everything from what Dylan may or may not have believed, to the ways spirituality emerges in his songs and music, to the shifting religious context framing his life, and much more.
