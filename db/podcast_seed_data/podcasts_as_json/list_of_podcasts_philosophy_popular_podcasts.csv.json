Each episode, we pick a short text and chat about it with some balance between insight and flippancy. You don't have to know any philosophy, or even to have read the text we're talking about to (mostly) follow and (hopefully) enjoy the discussion. For links to the texts we discuss and other info, check out www.partiallyexaminedlife.com.\n\nWe also feature episodes from other podcasts by our hosts to round out your partially examined life, including Pretty Much Pop (prettymuchpop.com, covering all media), Nakedly Examined Music (nakedlyexaminedmusic.com, deconstructing songs), and (sub)Text (lit, film, psychoanalysis).

Taking a pro-intersectional approach to their activism, Callie and Nichole “attack” a wide range of topics from an anti-capitalist, feminist, anarchist, vegan perspective. Episodes can cover anything from why everyone should be anti-mass incarceration to why the movie Interstellar is a sexist, pro-colonialist piece of garbage. We talk dating advice, boundaries, consent culture, advocating for yourself and your ethics, how to build community, and doing vegan activism in a way that is not oppressive. Plus, rants, tangents, dad jokes and more from two hilariously and unapologetically angry women.",

The book was not written with the intent to be published.  It offers a noteworthy chain of challenging situations which are a reflection on spirituality and enumerate the struggle to understand oneself and one's role in the universe.  Written in the style of a journal, Meditations emphasizes that life in this world is short.\n\nAurelius was a stoic philosopher who had influenced the thoughts of many leaders in his time.  The first of several overarching themes in Meditations is to evaluate self judgment and judgment of others.  Another theme is that everything comes from nature and will return to nature once again.  A final theme is to maintain focus and be attentive.\n\nThe author establishes the point that we should enjoy the things that are possible and within our reach and at the same time recognize that other thins our outside of our control and should not concern us.\n\nAurelius uses statements to emphasize faith in God and how to lead a good life in the face of temptation.  This book provides support and personal comfort and is a captivating read.",

This show aims to bring those two together in a holistic style approach.  The recent explosion of the spread of information that the internet has given us has created more of a  raised awareness in the population.  We must continue to help in any way we can to have more people awake and aware. \nThis show is all about changing the world and honoring the rights to direct experience, cognitive liberty and freedom for all human beings. \n \n Hope you enjoy it, and if you do, please subscribe and leave me a 5-star rating and review on iTunes.

This course will examine a number of issues that arise once we begin to reflect on our mortality. The possibility that death may not actually be the end is considered. Are we, in some sense, immortal? Would immortality be desirable? Also a clearer notion of what it is to die is examined. What does it mean to say that a person has died? What kind of fact is that? And, finally, different attitudes to death are evaluated. Is death an evil? How? Why? Is suicide morally permissible? Is it rational? How should the knowledge that I am going to die affect the way I live my life?\n\nThis class was recorded in Spring 2007.",

        "description": "Tune in to the Always Already Podcast for indulgent conversations about critical theory (in the broadest read of the term!). Our podcast consists of two episode streams. The first is a discussion of texts spanning critical theory, political theory, social theory, and philosophy. We work through and analyze main ideas, underlying assumptions, connections with other texts and theories, and occasionally delve into the great abyss of free association, ad hoc theory jokes, and makeshift puns. The second stream, entitled Epistemic Unruliness, consists of interviews and discussions with activists, artists, and academics whose “disobedient” work builds upon the themes of that arise in the texts we discuss and in our ongoing podcast conversations.  \nIn the first stream we also entertain the questions of friends and strangers and dole out slapdash advice about everything from massaging a head of Brooklyn kale to sweet talking a nebechy philosopher and dealing with the vagaries of academic life. We also put on our Freud-Klein-Lacan-Irigaray hats as we provide dream analysis to (always already anonymized) listener dreams.\nBe a part by sending us text suggestions, interview ideas, advice questions to answer, and dreams to analyze. \nThe Always Already Podcast is created by B Aultman, Rachel Brown, Emily Crandall, John McMahon, and James Padilioni, Jr.",

        "description": "“A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts,” is one of the quotes from James Allen's classic self help books, As a Man Thinketh. Published in 1902, it provides many more such insightful concepts on the power of thought and its effect on a human being's personality and behavior.\n\nThis volume is more of a literary essay than a complete book and its title is based on a Biblical proverb, “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” Taking this piece of ancient wisdom further, James Allen explores the far-reaching effects of the inner workings of a person's mind and motivation. He proposes that projecting one's own desires, goals and needs in the outer world can provide clues to a person's character.\n\nThinking and the subconscious mind are assumed to be hidden from the outside world, and hence powerless to change the course of events or circumstances of one's life. However, in this book, Allen presents ideas that can harness this subterranean force and bend our lives to our will if we so choose.\n\nJames Allen was a British writer who wrote mostly about everyday philosophy for the lay person and was in a sense, a pioneer of the self help movement. His books and poems were inspirational pieces, meant to help people realize their own powers and take charge of their lives rather than being mere tools in the hands of destiny. Born in a working class family in Leicester, England, Allen and his younger brother grew up in straitened circumstances. His father, a factory worker, traveled to America in search of a better job, but was tragically attacked and killed by criminals in New York. James, the older son, was compelled to leave school and seek work back in England. He found employment as a secretary to a stationer and later worked as a journalist. He later discovered a deep and enduring interest in spiritual matters when he began working as a writer with a magazine devoted to spiritual themes. His first book From Poverty to Power was published in 1901. Subsequently, he also launched his own spiritual magazine.\n\nAs a Man Thinketh was his third and most famous book. It became an instant bestseller and the sales of this tiny volume were so great that they allowed Allen and his family to retire to the country, buy a house and live in relative comfort for the rest of their life.\n\nThe book's language is very simple and the message presented here will certainly provide a basis for further thought and meditation.",

I'm an INFJ and I'm here to show you through my podcast that you are not alone, you are not crazy, you are not autistic, or a sociopath. You are just misunderstood, and the more you realize that there are others like you out there, the less alone and confused you are going to feel. You are here to fulfill a great purpose. The purpose of the INFJ is diverse, beautiful, and unicorn-like, just like you.\nLet me help you, through this podcast, and my YouTube channel, to help you gain a better understanding of yourself, and to become the best version of yourself as much as possible. I'm Boom Shikha on YouTube, and there are hundreds of INFJ videos on there, that are waiting for your conscious understanding. Much love! See you on the other side, lovely INFJs.",

        "description": "A Universalist book, The Age of Reason advocates for the existence of natural religion and challenges the structure of all organized religion. First written and distributed as pamphlets, the book was later published into two parts. Paine puts forward his personal beliefs, debating reason and revelation, while analyzing the Bible and the influence organized religion has on society. Exploring topics including natural religion, criticism of corrupt religious institutions, and distinction between rationality and blind faith in the supernatural, the book presents a guide for the conscious and free spiritual thinkers.\n\nFollowing the style and influence of the Enlightenment ideals of logic and reason, the first part of the book focuses on the Paine’s personal creeds about God and the established religion which he believes is manipulated by organized religious institutions. He further goes on to exemplify his critical view of established religion by illustrating the inconsistencies in the Christian Bible, while examining both miracle and prophecy. He questions the legitimacy of the Bible as an accurate account of Christian beliefs and classifies it to be a word of man and not of God. Paine uses the book to outline his analytical objections to theism and as a means to support his belief in deism.\n\nDistinctive for its clear and straightforward linguistic style, Paine’s political language was aimed to bring politics to a mass audience, not just the educated population.  Incorporating rhetorical questions and repetition throughout the piece, Paine encourages the audience to independently complete the views and arguments he presents rather than impose his creeds upon them.  The Age of Reason supports the idea that in order to discover the true grandeur of God, one should worship individually and without dictation from society.  A compelling, meticulous and notable critique, Paine’s work is marked as a theological eye-opener and an insight into deism, whilst also regarded as a pervasive influence even in present secular society.",

        "description": "What are you doing with your life? Can anyone show you the way, or must you be a light to yourself? Do we see the urgency of change? One of the greatest spiritual teachers of all time, Krishnamurti challenges us to question all that we know and discover our true nature in the here and now. Krishnamurti deeply inspired many well known figures, such as Bruce Lee, Eckhart Tolle, Jack Nicholson, Van Morrison, Deepak Chopra, George Lucas, Aldous Huxley, and Jack Kornfield. This official podcast by Krishnamurti Foundation Trust features conversations between Krishnamurti and luminaries from many paths, readings of a classic by actor Terence Stamp and much more.

        "description": "Mathematical Philosophy - the application of logical and mathematical methods in philosophy - is about to experience a tremendous boom in various areas of philosophy. At the new Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy, which is funded mostly by the German Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, philosophical research will be carried out mathematically, that is, by means of methods that are very close to those used by the scientists.\nThe purpose of doing philosophy in this way is not to reduce philosophy to mathematics or to natural science in any sense; rather mathematics is applied in order to derive philosophical conclusions from philosophical assumptions, just as in physics mathematical methods are used to derive physical predictions from physical laws.\nNor is the idea of mathematical philosophy to dismiss any of the ancient questions of philosophy as irrelevant or senseless: although modern mathematical philosophy owes a lot to the heritage of the Vienna and Berlin Circles of Logical Empiricism, unlike the Logical Empiricists most mathematical philosophers today are driven by the same traditional questions about truth, knowledge, rationality, the nature of objects, morality, and the like, which were driving the classical philosophers, and no area of traditional philosophy is taken to be intrinsically misguided or confused anymore. It is just that some of the traditional questions of philosophy can be made much clearer and much more precise in logical-mathematical terms, for some of these questions answers can be given by means of mathematical proofs or models, and on this basis new and more concrete philosophical questions emerge. This may then lead to philosophical progress, and ultimately that is the goal of the Center.",

        "description": "He was a trusted aide of Henry VIII, but when he supposedly opposed the monarch's second marriage, he was thrown into prison and executed for treason. More than two hundred years later, he was canonized as the patron saint of statesmen and politicians by the Catholic Church. Philosopher, writer, diplomat, lawyer, Renaissance man, avid gardener, humanist thinker and statesman are only some of the words used to describe him. A lifelong opponent of Protestantism who was rumored to have had heretics imprisoned, murdered and burned at the stake, Thomas More is even today an enigmatic figure.\n\nPublished in Latin in 1516, Utopia is Sir Thomas More's best known and most debated work. It begins as an apparently real account of one of More's diplomatic missions on behalf of his king. Some of the characters mentioned in this section are contemporary historical figures. In the course of his sojourn on board a ship to Antwerp, he meets a man called Raphael Hythloday who he assumes is the ship's captain. Hythloday, a much traveled raconteur is glad to share stories of his experiences in various exotic lands. He tells of his voyages with the famous Amerigo Vespucci and one of the strange countries he visited was the Island of Utopia.\n\nThe book is divided into two parts. Sir Thomas describes in great detail the history, geography, demographics and politics of his fictional country. It is portrayed as the ideal state in all ways. A welfare state, it does not allow its citizens to own private property. Agriculture is the most highly respected job on the island and crime is almost nonexistent. Men and women do the same kind of work. They are trained in at least one trade. However, slavery does exist and is actively practiced in Utopia. Euthanasia is allowed and indeed welcomed by older people and priests are allowed to marry. Though divorce is permitted, premarital relationships are punished under the law. There is a community dining room where every citizen takes meals and travel within the island is permissible only by means of an internal passport. There are no lawyers in Utopia! Religions are many, but atheists are condemned. There are several such interesting aspects in the book.\n\nSuch is Thomas More's vision of the ideal state. Scholars have attempted to understand his motive behind writing the treatise. Ideas such as euthanasia, noncelibate priesthood, divorce etc seem to have been diametrically opposite to the teachings of the Catholic Church in which he believed so strongly. Paradoxical also is his condemnation of the law and lawyers, since he was a brilliant one himself.\n\nIn spite of these contradictions Utopia remains one of the most humane and interesting fantasies and a great addition to your repertoire.",

        "description": "Bushido: The Soul of Japan written by Inazo Nitobe was one of the first books on samurai ethics that was originally written in English for a Western audience, and has been subsequently translated into many other languages (also Japanese). Nitobe found in Bushido, the Way of the Warrior, the sources of the virtues most admired by his people: rectitude, courage, benevolence, politeness, sincerity, honor, loyalty and self-control, and he uses his deep knowledge of Western culture to draw comparisons with Medieval Chivalry, Philosophy, and Christianity.",
