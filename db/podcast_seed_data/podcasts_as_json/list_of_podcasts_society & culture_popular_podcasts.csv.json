From humble beginnings, Epstein came to amass significant wealth which he used to buy sex, social status, silence, even justice —until money wasn’t enough.

It's become a symbol for strength, a posture of possibility, the idea that when we stand tall, arms bent, looking right at it, we can make a difference.\nAkimbo's a podcast about our culture and about how we can change it. About seeing what's happening and choosing to do something.\nThe culture is real, but it can be changed. You can bend it.",

Every week, subscribers will receive a new Meditative Story from a storyteller who will transport listeners to the time and place where everything changed for them — a story that may be deeply relatable to the listener’s own life. As the story unfolds, mindfulness guide Rohan Gunatillake (founder of the popular Buddhify meditation app) offers prompts to calm the mind, and help listeners connect with their own observations. The entire experience is elevated by gorgeous music. Shifting between music and vibration, the exquisite sound design rides above the narrative, bringing each Meditative Story to life and giving subscribers the headspace to feel restored and refreshed. Meditative Story is a WaitWhat original series — created by the team who built and led TED’s media organization — in close partnership with Arianna Huffington’s Thrive Global. The series is made possible with generous support from Salesforce.",

I’ve been an actor since I was thirteen - I’ve had the immense pleasure of creating TV shows and movies in which every story has a beginning, middle and end. But we all know, life isn’t like that. There are so many experiences in my life I haven’t gotten into because I didn’t feel like the media was the best place to open up about them. But this feels like a really great place for me to sit down with some incredible, smart and interesting people that I’ve met through my work and have those meaningful conversations with. Each week, I’m going to sit down with another guest as we try to be fully open and honest with each other and hopefully learn a thing or two along the way.",

        "description": "Earth Ancients chronicles the growing (and often suppressed) evidence of known and unknown civilizations, their ruined cities, and artifacts developed from advanced science and technology. Erased from the pages of time, these cultures discovered and charted the heavens, developed medicine and unleashed advancements that parallel and, in many cases, surpass our own. Join us and discover our lost history.\nArmed with the thousands of anomalous archeological discoveries which have not been covered by conventional science and the media, we can no longer deny our ancient cultural inheritance. Our written history is wrong and we’ve been led to believe that humanity is just a few hundred thousand years old. In fact, the Hindu Yugas advance the notion that Homo Sapiens are millions of years old, and have lived onplanet Earth through a series of rebirths.It’s now a fact that we are the survivors of a series of cataclysmic events that took place approximately 12,000 to 14,000 years ago. Our ancestors may have been aware of these impending disasters and fled underground shelter, or survived in caves; others may have left the planet, but a huge number perished.      \nThough Earth Ancients does explore some of the popular theories that ancient aliens have visited our\n\nplanet, our philosophy and research paradigm is decidedly Earth-centric, elevating the historical discourseabout human brilliance and ingenuity found in the archaeological evidence.",

        "description": "Grounded in the topics that distract host Kate Kennedy (entrepreneur, author, pop culture commentator) on a daily basis, Be There in Five explores all facets of popular culture in a thoughtful, analytical, editorialized, and comedic format. Kate covers a wide range of topics reflecting the current zeitgeist, i.e. celebrities, bloggers/influencers, social media, and tv/moves/music, but also focuses on the humor found in reexamining the 90s/00s zeitgeist as an adult, from AIM to Zenon.   Whether musing about how so many 24-year-old bloggers have 5 kids and millions of dollars, poking holes in popular self-help gurus advice, deep diving about influencer/social media scandals, or explaining Taylor Swift's clue-dropping marketing strategy, Kate aims to dive into the topics everyone's talking about in chat rooms that don't get represented in newsrooms. (And by chat rooms, she realizes it's not 1999, but it sounded more quippy than online forums and Facebook groups). Beyond the more lighthearted topics, Kate is also a seasoned entrepreneur (of her namesake company Be There in Five) who is honest about her struggles in real-time and invites her listeners along as she, too, is trying to make it as a 30 something living in Chicago. Above all else, Kate started this podcast to champion lovers of pop culture by taking the guilt out of guilty pleasures. By speaking about the zeitgeist in an intelligent, unique, and humorous way, she hopes to assure listeners that these topics have value, contribute to society, and the only naïve people are those who refuse to acknowledge their influence.",
