Who hasn’t wanted the chance to hang out with the real life warriors who can do Jason Bourne and James Bond type stuff? \n\nAnd here’s the thing…how would you ever find these guys to buy them a beer and hopefully hear a story or two? They excel at all things covert and the most talented operators tend to be incredibly humble, true to the code of “quiet professionals” – so it will definitely not be obvious that they are, who they are...folks in the business of protecting the United States and impossibly good at it. \n\nWell, now you know where to find them. Every week, you’ve got a seat at the table. From Special Operations ultimate tactical professionals through to 4-Star Generals and Admirals, host Allison Barrie will introduce you to a line up of fascinating warriors who you need to meet.\n\nSo what do these guys talk about when they hang out together?

        "description": "The Supreme Court of the United States is divided, and it's not the first time.  For over two centuries, the justices on the nation's highest bench have argued with one another over the direction to take country.  From Brown v. Board of Education to Roe v. Wade, the Court has repeatedly transformed American society and remains a polarizing political subject today.\n\nAnd yet no one really talks about what exactly happened in all of these cases.  For instance, no one talks about how contraception, abortion, interracial marriage, homosexuality, and same-sex marriage were all legalized nationally because of one sentence in the Constitution!  And no one talks about who made Brown v. Board of Education possible and how the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution has changed over time.\n\nIn May it Please the Court, Alex Akhavan narrates the riveting events that connect the most important cases in U.S. history.  Each season is one story about one part of the Constitution, and each episode tells its own tale about the context, the personalities, and the legal arguments that changed the country and the world.",

        "description": "The signature program of the nonprofit, Advancing the Interests of Animals (AIA), is its weekly, one-hour nationally syndicated radio show, Animals Today.  Currently in its seventh continuous year, this show provides a worldwide platform where individuals and organizations concerned about the welfare of animals can present their viewpoints and promote their causes.  It is a communication hub where listeners learn about a wide variety of animal welfare issues as well as the actions they can take to help animals locally and around the globe. Hosted by Dr. Lori Kirshner and co-host/producer Dr. Peter Spiegel, Animals Today airs in multiple markets with a potential audience of millions of listeners.  Listeners worldwide may enjoy live shows via internet streaming, and past shows are archived on the Animals Today website and YouTube for free access anytime. Shows can also be accessed as podcasts on iTunes, on Spreaker, on Tune in radio, and on i heart radio.\n\n\n\nDifferent than other radio programs whose focus is merely on pets, Animals Today delves deeper by also promoting increased respect, compassion and kindness toward animals in the wild and farmed animals.  Via analysis and commentary, it provides the latest thinking and news about animal rights with the goal of educating listeners of all ages about the current status of animals in society and how people can treat them more humanely.  The show’s hosts conduct interviews on a wide variety of animal-related topics with news items from around the globe. Programs have focused on such diverse subjects as the dangers wind farms pose to eagles, shark conservation efforts and language and communication research in non-human animals.\n\n\n\nGuests on the show have included celebrities, filmmakers, politicians and government officials, lawyers, authors, scientists, ecologists, food producers, naturalists and activists working in the field. They all share a desire to improve the lives of animals around the world.  A few of Animals Today’s noteworthy guests have included Bob Barker, Author Dean Koontz, Actress Tippi Hedren, US Representative Tom Marino, CA Assemblymember Richard Bloom, CT State Representative Fred Camillo, award-winning independent journalist Will Potter, and President, Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, Dr. Neal Barnard. Lori and Peter have gone on site to cover The Best Friends National Conference, the FARM animal rights conference, the Born Free USA Primate Sanctuary in Texas, and other events and locations of interest.",
