Welcome to WorkParty the podcast. Where creative and entrepreneurial women celebrate each other’s successes. WorkParty is the vision of Jaclyn Johnson, the powerhouse founder and CEO behind Create & Cultivate, the fastest growing online platform and conference for millennial women in business. In WorkParty the book, Jaclyn spills on how she found the determination to flip her rock bottom moment into hard work and success —and how you can, too.

WorkParty the podcast is all the lessons she learned and the advice she wishes she had gotten along the way. You’ll hear from female founders, CEOs, entrepreneurs, creatives and so many other badass boss ladies. And what do you get from listening? We’re keeping it 100, giving you that career real-talk, and no BS advice.\n\nTo check out the WorkParty blog and learn more about the WorkParty book and tour visit WorkParty.com.

        "description": "Marketing Your Business is a podcast dedicated to all things marketing.  It’s a behind the scenes look at the marketing tactics and strategies that lead to a loyal following, growing sales and a business that gives you (the business owner) more freedom in your everyday life.  Each episode will be short, punchy and packed with takeaways to help you get what you have, in front of a lot more people.  It’s about leveraging your marketing to build a business that is high in profit, low in stress and one that gives you the ability and freedom to have the greatest impact on the world.  \n\nJoin leading online marketing strategist and entrepreneur, Stu McLaren, as he shares what’s working selling products online with product launches, online communities, email marketing,  social media marketing, content marketing, pay per click marketing and so much more.  This is about the marketing that leads to more sales, more profits and a high growth business.  \n\nWith that said, this show is not just about making money.  It’s about using the power of marketing to give you more freedom. The freedom to work with who you want, where you want while having the time to travel and do all the things you want. It’s about reducing the “go-go-go” stress and instead redesigning your business so you can be more present in the lives of those that matter most to you. To laugh more, live more and to create a real difference in the world.\n \nFor years, Stu McLaren has helped experts transform their knowledge and influence into recurring revenue by launching, growing and scaling 7 and 8-figure membership sites. In 2008, he co-founded the world’s most popular membership platform for WordPress (WishList Member). He then went on to partner with New York Times best-selling author Michael Hyatt, helping his company go from a high 6-figure business (with lots of stress) to a high 7-figure business (with low-stress). Michael’s profitability soared, his email list grew from 70,000 to over 500,000 and he gained back over 100 days with his family by not having to travel.\n \nToday, Stu coaches and consults other elite level entrepreneurs, experts and influencers, who want the same kind of growth without the stress or tension of neglecting the things that matter most. So, if you’ve got an established business and you’re looking for ideas on how you can get your products and services in front of more people OR you’re someone who is thinking about starting a business and you want to see the behind the scenes of another entrepreneur doing it in in real time, the Marketing Your Business podcast is a show that is tailor made for you.",
