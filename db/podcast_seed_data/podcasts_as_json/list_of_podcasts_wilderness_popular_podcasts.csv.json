Bronson Strickland and Steve Demarais are both deer hunters, deer biologists, professors of wildlife management, and co-directors of the Mississippi State University Deer Lab. Steve and Bronson are so crazy about deer biology and management that they made it their career!\n \nOur goal is to explain how you can use deer research to improve your hunting and management experiences. Don’t take for granted what your buddy says or what you read in a hunting magazine – we’ll train you to think like a deer biologist. As national leaders in deer research, we’ll keep you up to date on the latest and best information, and deliver episodes that cover every deer management topic you can imagine, and then add some that will surprise you.\n \nIf you are interested in deer hunting and management, this is your podcast! Every shot you take this fall is either a step forward or backward in your management program, so use our knowledge to make every shot count!\n \nHosts of Deer University:\nDr. Bronson Strickland, Professor of Wildlife Management, Mississippi State University Extension Service\nDr. Steve Demarais, Professor of Wildlife Management, Mississippi State University Forest and Wildlife Research Center",

Many people consider trapping a dying art, but there is still plenty of interest whether from outdoorsmen and women who are looking to further their outdoor skills, wildlife managers looking to enhance game populations through predator control, or survivalists interesting in knowing how to obtain food and fur in a survival situation.  Follow along as Kris gives trapping industry updates, instructional information, and updates on his wintertime trapline.  With a wide array of experience, from trapping artic foxes in Alaska to alligators in Florida, and a degree in wildlife biology, Kris’ passion lies in wildlife management and matching wits with wild critters near and far.",
