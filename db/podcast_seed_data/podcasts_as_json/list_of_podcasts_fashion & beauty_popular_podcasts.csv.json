We live in ever changing and sometimes challenging times, so being informed and constantly inspired is more important than ever. \n\nJoin Antony Whitaker talking to thought leaders on the business side of the hairdressing industry discussing insightful, provocative and inspiring ideas that matter.

I ditched all my makeup once I found out about all the harmful and toxic ingredients hiding in them and switched over to green beauty. This was one of the best decisions of my life, and since I've made it a priority to share my green journey and lifestyle change to help others make a change in their own life! While my toxic-free journey started with beauty, I later started looking in to my everyday home products and continue to switch over to greener lifestyle for a better body, home and environment!\n\n\n\nOn the podcast, I interview experts, founders, business owners, bloggers, nutritionists, doctors and people like you and me; to discuss everything from clean beauty, to healing our bodies, changing our mindset and habits, establishing and flourishing our brand and career, and being the best versions of ourselves.",

But jewelry can tell a larger story, one reflecting the connection between contemporary culture and that of yesteryear.\n\nIs jewelry clothing, art, status symbol, or something more? The jewelry world seems to be hidden in plain sight and little understood. The Jewelry Journey podcast explores the many aspects of jewelry and its status as art. We talk with those who live and breathe this form of adornment: makers, dealers, gallerists, academics collectors and more. The goal is to elevate the conversation beyond Etsy or big diamonds and see jewelry in a new light, so that we can appreciate the little pieces of wonder that float by each day.",
