If you'd like to hear our new episodes, simply search for New York City History: The Bowery Boys and subscribe.\n\nNew York City history is America's history. It's the hometown of the world, and most people knows its familiar landmarks, buildings and streets. Why not look a little closer and have fun while doing it?\n\nThe Bowery Boys, Greg Young and Tom Meyers, have lived in New York for the last fifteen years and have been curious about the city since the day they arrived. Join them for a fun take on history, a \"romp down the back alleys of New York City.\" \n\nEach week, they look into another fascinating aspect of the Big Apple -- the people, the places, its beginnings and effects on American culture.",

With each stop in each park, Brad and Matt Kirouac immerse themselves and the listeners – and the Kirouacs' dog Finn!  – in these beautiful, larger-than-life places. They share discoveries about what makes the national parks truly special, from the intimidating wildlife of the Everglades to the cinematic lore of Redwood. It's all that and a dash of what it’s really like to live in an RV full time.",

It will examine colonial society, slavery, and what life was like for the region’s inhabitants during this period. We will look at what caused the wars of independence, how they were won, and what Latin America looked like afterwards.\n\nThe region’s twentieth century history was marked by extremes – in political ideas, in levels of wealth, and in cultural expression. It was a time of guerrillas, dictators, death squads, powerful corporations, and turmoil. The cold war was played out in extreme here – although filtered through the legacy of colonialism and the region’s own unique heritage.\n\nAll this and more make Latin American history a fascinating story, and one worth telling. Join me on this podcast as I set about doing so.﻿",

        "description": "Hello and welcome to Ohio Folklore.  I’m your host, Melissa Davies, and I’m delighted to serve as your guide through some of Ohio’s most treasured, and often misunderstood, folk legends.  We’ll explore locations that have inspired a sense of wonder, awe and mystery.  We’ll scour historical facts to lay out what can be known.  We’ll explore oral histories from local people who’ve had first hand encounters with the places and legends themselves.  And, lastly, we’ll consider the unexplained, the unresolved, the missing pieces.  \n\nWhat keeps a legend alive is a mix of critical ingredients.  You’ve got to have a sense of uniqueness, of being out of place.  You’ve got to have an element of significance, of a message that speaks deeply in its universal truth.  But lastly, and most importantly, you’ve got to have that feeling of curiosity, of a puzzle with a few vital pieces missing.  Our minds want to fill it in, to make it whole.  And that, my friends, is where folklore is born.  It’s is a collection of stories we humans tell about the places and events that seem bigger than ourselves; that seem too fantastical for history books; that seem too mysterious for museums.  Many of the stories we’ll cover in this podcast will say as much about the storytellers as the subject matter itself.  The teller and the story cannot be separated.  Sometimes, what’s conjured up to fill in the gaps, tells us more about ourselves than we realize.  The legends we’ll cover will address our deepest fears, our most heartfelt wishes and our most ardent desire for something beyond our mundane lives.",

It all started on a surf trip to Costa Rica in the mid 90's, where your host Josh Linnes fell in love with the tropical region. Since then he founded several companies including www. vivatropical.com, created real estate projects in Costa Rica and Panama, eventually buying his own island in Panama with his business partner Park Wilson. \n\nAs comfortable in a dug out canoe as as a yacht, his adventures take him and his business partner into uncharted regions.\n\nJosh is a proponent of living simply while focusing on getting the most out of life. His love of exploring and experiencing everything the diverse region has to offer is obvious. \n\nOn its surface the show is about the Latin Tropics, but the hosts multitude of interests take the show much deeper. From strange local myths and unique plants, to how to retire to the region. From offshore investment strategy to how to build a sailboat. \n\nYou are welcome to enjoy an eclectic mix of interviews, how to's, local hacks, investment strategy, surfing stories, environmental coverage, off-grid information, coffee talk, and much more. \n\nHaving a radio show is an excuse for Josh to draw in interesting people that hopefully teach listeners something new.\n\nGet to know a region better while discovering about all types of different subjects designed to help you break free and thrive.",
