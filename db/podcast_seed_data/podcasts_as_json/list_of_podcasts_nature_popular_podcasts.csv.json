And the economic value of insect pollination worldwide is estimated to be about $217 billion. But as important as bees have become for farming, there’s also increasing signs that bees are in trouble. In the decade-plus since the first cases of Colony Collapse Disorder were reported, bees are still dying in record numbers, and important questions remain unanswered. \n\nOver the course of one year, host Adam Allington and environment reporters David Schultz and Tiffany Stecker traveled to all corners of the honeybee ecosystem from Washington, D.C., to the California almond fields, and orchards of the upper Midwest to bring back answers to these questions.",

        "description": "The Marine Conservation Happy Hour is a podcast that looks at the many different sides of Marine Science and Conservation in an informal setting - a during a pub Happy Hour, chatting casually over a few (or more) drinks. The show is co-hosted by Andrew Lewin, @Craken_McCraic, @DrScarlettSmash and @MarineBrit. Everyone is a marine scientist who is passionate about the Ocean, marine mammals (whales, seals, dolphins, porpoises, polar bears and more), sharks and other fish, invertebrates (especially squid & octopuses because they are cool), and other marine biology things that live under the sea. Join us as we gossip about, for example, how shows like Game of Thrones are similar to Marine Conservation, the sex lives of sea creatures, hot marine science & conservation topics of the week and learn about the challenges of attaining a marine biology or conservation career.",

The effects of climate change are all around us, impacting our daily lives, our homes, where we work, where our children play, and the places that we love.

As the state’s largest private owner of coastal property, the Trustees of Reservations is working to protect some of our most vulnerable places—cultural and historic treasures—for today and for future generations. In this podcast we will share with you not only the “why,” but the “what.” The boots-on-the-ground, action happening in and around your communities as part of our coastal vision.
