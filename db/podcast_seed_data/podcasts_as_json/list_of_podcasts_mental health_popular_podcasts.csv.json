Even though he was a licensed therapist, John preferred casual over clinical in his approach. He blogged about his shortcomings, revelations, and his views on relationships, the self help business, and the world. He found CrossFit, bought a motorcycle, and started coaching people in unconventional ways. Through this process, he came up with his own concepts. He realized that there was a new way to help others, combining what he learned in therapy school with life coaching and using technology to be mobile and create online communities, but most importantly, he took a very different approach, one frowned upon by the rigid and antiquated therapy world. He practiced transparency. People keep asking him why he calls himself The Angry Therapist. His reply: It’s my way of saying I’m human.   \n\nLearn more about John here: www.theangrytherapist.com",

Nobody can take the first tentative steps towards sobriety without first getting past denial, but even once they are past denial the stigma surrounding alcoholism is so strong that people are reluctant to seek help.\n\nThe Bubble Hour would like to change that stigma. Jean and the vibrant community of sober people who join her here, will be recording and offering this show for anyone to listen to for information, community, empathy and understanding.\n\nWe are so grateful for the sober people who came before us to help find this path; this is one way to give back.\n\nPlease help us spread the word about this website and the pod casts; you may be helping someone you know well but don't even know they have a problem.\n\nAlcoholism thrives in the dark.  Together, we bring light.  And hope.",

Erica shares the best kept secrets of the therapy world, bringing you knowledge and education that puts you in the driver's seat of your emotional and psychological well being.

        "description": "In this podcast, we explore how sensitivity weaves itself into our lives.  We talk about the richness that it adds, and the strengths we have BECAUSE of our sensitivity and some of the challenges it poses as well. If you are a Creative, a deep thinker, a deep feeler, a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP), an introvert, or identify as INFJ or ENFJ, you may enjoy the in-depth conversations where we talk openly and honestly about how we experience life. This is a podcast where you can learn, relate, laugh and maybe even live a bolder, brighter life.\n\n\nHave you been told you’re “too” (fill in the blank)? You’re too sensitive; you think/worry too much; you take things too personally; you’re too emotional, too finicky, too fragile, too intense, too uptight, too slow. Have you been told you can’t take a joke; you can’t go with the flow? You can’t let go of things? Making decisions can be very difficult. You might have an acute sense of smell, and strong odors, crowded noisy environments and bright lights are just too much!\n\nYou notice things that no one else does. You have a strong sense of justice and you may be a peace-keeper. Conflict feels uncomfortable. You’re the one that everyone tells their problems to because you’re a good listener who cares deeply.\n\nYou’re in the right place!\n\nYou may have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, ADHD or something else.  Sometimes Highly Sensitive People are misdiagnosed. Our brains are wired differently.  We are born with the trait of High Sensitivity.  There’s nothing wrong with you! You will learn that your perceived weaknesses are really are your superpowers! Dr. Elaine Aron coined the term Highly Sensitive Person (also known as Sensory Processing Sensitivity).",

If you’ve ever felt like you aren’t really equipped to help your clients, if you sometimes think in the middle of a session “this person should be with a real therapist”, if you’ve ever felt like you are faking it, if you’ve ever looked around the room at a training and felt like an impostor, then welcome. You’ve come to the right place. Our show is about connecting people together within the psychotherapy community who share this kind of experience. To understand that it’s not about being perfect. Rather, it’s about having the courage to enter into the dark and lonely spaces of people’s lives. Recognizing there isn’t often an easy way out, but being willing to walk alongside people in the darkness as we, ourselves, also journey. Coming to know that being vulnerable and leaning into the imperfect leads to something better for all of us.",

My goal is to share the parallel journey we as healers walk along with our clients and how we attend to our own humanity while caring for others. \n\nMy podcast is about conversations and community building, what we can learn from each other, and how we can help heal each other. We’re cultivating a space where we celebrate vulnerability, authenticity and “showing up.”\n\nIt’s a place to meet people I think will inspire you, help you heal and grow – and who you can relate to at the same time. \n\nI’m inspired by C.G. Jung’s “wounded healer” concept, where the healer’s own hurt that gives the measure of his own power to heal. \n\nAnother one of my heroes, Brene Brown, puts it best: “Mindfully practicing authenticity during our most soul-searching struggles is how we invite grace, joy and gratitude into our lives.” \n\nTogether, I hope this marriage of vulnerability and professionalism will inspire and entertain you...enjoy!",

        "description": "ADHD is one of the most researched yet least understood conditions of our time.  Living Beyond ADHD host, Dr B, is here to explore relevant information that just isn't making it from the experts to the general public, and to close that gap.  Those diagnoses missed in earlier years and made in adulthood, add many burdens to the discovery.  Failed marriages, bankruptcy, unemployment, academic failure, underachieving, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and a deep mistrust of self, are just the tip of the iceberg.  In order to live a happier, more productive and successful adult life in today’s world, you must learn the essential executive function skills and strategies.  Those under-developed skills and strategies rather than just your ADHD could be what are driving your greatest challenges.",

The more I told my story, the more I realized people were genuinely interested in my struggles, without passing the judgement I was always fearful of. I discovered that people wanted and needed to talk about their stories and struggles, and began to confide in me. I started to realize we all have a past with difficulties, and we are probably going through with some hard things at this very moment. But it's up to us to not let our past or current struggles define us. We have to take responsibility for our own lives and emotions, because we can use them to create a life we love. The 6 Feet Above podcast will explore this process in each episode. It will be a place to share people's stories of struggle and success. To find out what worked for them in creating a life of happiness. Some weeks it may get pretty dark as we discuss serious topics. Other weeks it may be a bit lighter. But each week we will discover real people, who have overcome their obstacles, to live a life of joy and positivity. I hope you will join me on this journey. I'm Megan Armstrong. Welcome to life 6 Feet Above.",

She dealt with 6 years of trying to be a mom before she decided to live child free - on purpose.  Her husband intervened, however, when he insisted on being a dad.  And, due to her zen mindset at the time, she agreed.  They are now the proud, happy, (mostly) zen parents of two boys via adoption.  \n\n\n\nMaria gets you - both personally and professionally.  Her doctoral research questioned why she felt so friggin' happy after the trauma of infertility and BEFORE she was a mom.  She learned some things then, and she is a constant student of the experience now.  This podcast is all about paying her knowledge, experience, and insights forward to YOU.  \n\n\n\nShe has seen many women through to their miracles (babies, improved relationships, improved mindset, better health, more peace, and a calm zest for life that cannot be measured).  Listen in for some laughs, honest reflection, practical tips, and wisdom from somebody who gets it.",

        "description": "The Food is Not Bae Podcast is a podcast that goes beyond the typical verbiage of weight loss and diet culture. In a homegirl, down-to-earth, yet professional, type of way, Dr. Ebony chats with you about ways to free yourself from societal, familial, and cultural messages rooted in the diet culture that is keeping you stuck in a toxic relationship with food. Dr. Ebony will discuss the issues we don't want to talk about or want anybody to know - those internal (and external) issues leading to weight gain and the underlying struggles to take it off. Yes, she goes there! Dr. Ebony, a licensed Psychologist, Author, and Food Relationship Guide, talks about the difficult issues in efforts to help you, and your communities, better understand where toxic relationships with food begin and how to restructure them in healthier ways. Episodes focus on the links between food and issues like rejection, betrayal, trauma, loneliness, grief, confusion, pain, religion, politics, culture, social approval, and so much more. Dr. Ebony goes beyond the regular path of providing dieting advice and, instead, digs deeper into real life issues. She connects how these issues are tied to mindset, food choices, disease, and the overall struggles people have with losing weight, being consistent, and following through. After digging into areas that have been hidden for so long, Dr. Ebony provides you with real talk and real tips and strategies for overcoming internal struggles and regaining control of your life and your health - on your terms!",
