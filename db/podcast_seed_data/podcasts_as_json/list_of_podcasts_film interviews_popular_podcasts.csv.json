D’être un flic infiltré au sein d’un gang, une astronaute perdue dans l’espace, un chercheur, une mère de famille, une victime, un bourreau, un étudiant en médecine, une exploratrice, un archéologue… Dans «Incarnations», Stéphanie Chermont et Marie Salah vont tenter de répondre à cette question. Avec une idée simple: faire se rencontrer un acteur ou une actrice et la personne qu’il ou elle incarne dans la vraie vie. Comment devient-on quelqu’un d’autre à l’écran? Cette personne, incarnée, se sent-elle bien représentée ? Le cinéma a-t-il le pouvoir de faire changer les choses?",
