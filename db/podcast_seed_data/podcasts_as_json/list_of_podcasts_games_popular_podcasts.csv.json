I had a lot of very specific questions I wanted to ask game designers and publishers, and as it turns out, they're more than happy to answer those questions when asked. So, I created the BGDL Podcast. I release a weekly show that interviews designers, publishers, and board game insiders on specific topics. We don't waste time talking about games we've played lately or get caught up on pop culture. There are plenty of other podcasts that do those things very well. Instead, the show does a deep dive into subjects that I hope listeners find extremely valuable as they progress through their game design journeys. The show comes out on Wednesdays.",

Each show includes light, friendly banter, a game review (in print), a combative segment called \"Brawling and Boardgaming\", and the fan favorite TNT (Then, Now Tomorrow)...  While the \"Brawling and Boardgaming\" can get a bit heated at times, Josh and Brandon play boadrgames for the same reason: SOCIAL INTERACTION. The Brawlers love of meeting new people, playing games with old friends and interact with gamers all around the world is the simple reason that Brawling Brothers was founded.

That is why we set up the This Week in Pinball website and podcast, as a one stop shop to check out the latest rumors and news.  Weekly posts go up every Monday which include noteworthy happenings in the pinball world, such as new games/rumors/mods, production and coding updates, pinball show reviews and announcements, results from competitions, notable pinball streams/videos/podcasts, and much more.  In addition to the weekly post, reviews, interviews, locations, and other pinball related articles will be posted sporadically.  This podcast covers all of that and more!",
