        "description": "Grounded in the topics that distract host Kate Kennedy (entrepreneur, author, pop culture commentator) on a daily basis, Be There in Five explores all facets of popular culture in a thoughtful, analytical, editorialized, and comedic format. Kate covers a wide range of topics reflecting the current zeitgeist, i.e. celebrities, bloggers/influencers, social media, and tv/moves/music, but also focuses on the humor found in reexamining the 90s/00s zeitgeist as an adult, from AIM to Zenon.   Whether musing about how so many 24-year-old bloggers have 5 kids and millions of dollars, poking holes in popular self-help gurus advice, deep diving about influencer/social media scandals, or explaining Taylor Swift's clue-dropping marketing strategy, Kate aims to dive into the topics everyone's talking about in chat rooms that don't get represented in newsrooms. (And by chat rooms, she realizes it's not 1999, but it sounded more quippy than online forums and Facebook groups). Beyond the more lighthearted topics, Kate is also a seasoned entrepreneur (of her namesake company Be There in Five) who is honest about her struggles in real-time and invites her listeners along as she, too, is trying to make it as a 30 something living in Chicago. Above all else, Kate started this podcast to champion lovers of pop culture by taking the guilt out of guilty pleasures. By speaking about the zeitgeist in an intelligent, unique, and humorous way, she hopes to assure listeners that these topics have value, contribute to society, and the only naïve people are those who refuse to acknowledge their influence.",

We started this podcast as an outlet for topics we are interested in, and for sharing stories we have as 20-30 something yr. old Asian American women working, dating, and living in Los Angeles.  It's no secret that Asian women are lacking in almost all media outlets. As three women working in finance, tech, and production who balance careers, life aspirations, and eventful social lives (we have our fair share of 5am returns from the club), we hope our perspectives can help, inform, and entertain those girls (and guys) with similar backgrounds or an interest in our backgrounds.   We like to think of this as our invitation for you to join our once private girl talk sessions! So grab a glass of wine and let's get this show started ;)",

Each episode is listener-funded, and show host Nicole Antoinette sits down with a wide range of beautifully imperfect people to talk about what's really going on in their lives. The conversations dive deep into topics like: work, love, sex, money, addiction, friendship, racism, body image, mental health, grief, fear, courage, change, and... everything in between. Listening to these stories will hopefully feel like a sigh of relief, reminding you that we’re all just doing the best we can, and that no matter what we’re in this together.

Melvin Federbush was born in Deblin, Poland, July 1923. He attended Cheder and Yeshiva as well as high school. Within eight days of Hitler's invasion of Poland, his parents and nine year old twin sisters were killed during a bombing attack. Melvin was taken prisoner during the Nazi occupation and forced to live in ghettos and concentration camps including Triglitz and the infamous Buchenwald.\n\nWhile being transported to Theresienstadt in a cattle car he escaped. Pretending to be a Polish Christian he managed to find work on a farm until the Russian army advanced into Germany and liberated prisoners in the area as well as him. Of his entire family of approximately 110 people, only he and his brother survived.\n\nAfter the war Melvin lived in Zurich and Lugano, Switzerland where he continued his education. In 1950 he immigrated to the United States and eventually became a fine arts dealer.\n\nMelvin is active in his community. He participates in the Westchester Holocaust Education Center, the Westchester Hemophilia Association, the Holocaust Museum in Washington, and the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York City. He is a member of Yad V'Shem in Jerusalem, the World Jewish Congress and B'nai B'rith, and a long-standing member of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\n\nMost recently he helped to organize the Holocaust Generations (children of survivors) and the Debliner Societies in NY and Florida. Melvin speaks publicly of his experiences to high school students and other organizations.",

        "description": "Adoptees telling their stories of life in adoption, the search for their birth family, and how their reunion attempt turned out. Stories that make you laugh, cry, or simply say \"wow\".\n\n\n\nThis podcast has two purposes: \n\n1) To help you explore your own feelings about your adoption, accept your desire to try to understand your own personal history, and decide for yourself whether a search for reunification with your biological relatives is right for you. It will help you understand how others have dealt with issues related to protecting the feelings of their adopted families who may be supportive of your search, or question your motives and present challenges.  \n\n\n\n2) For non-adoptees, this podcast will help you understand some of what is in the minds of your friends, family members, or others who are adopted, but you didn’t know if you should ask some of the questions that will be answered here.\n\n\n\nThe stories will make you smile or bring you to tears, but they’re all true as told by the people who lived them. In them, I hope you’ll find something that inspires you, validates your feelings about wanting to search, or motivates you to have the strength along your journey to learn “Who Am I Really?”",

Aurora Remember Holtzman has news: you are not too much. Perhaps you simply haven’t embraced your naturally excitable self? In “Embracing Intensity,” Aurora will take everything you think you know about what it means to be intense and excitable, and show you how intensity is not a weakness but a hidden power. Each week, Aurora will interview a strong, creative, and sensitive woman who embodies what it means to embrace intensity in order to show you how to embrace your life in its fullest. Listen to unlock ways to unleash your inner fire— without getting burned!",

Beyond the failings of law enforcement and the court system to provide justice, it is, perhaps most painfully, family and friends that let victims down.  “This Happened” is one woman’s exploration of this phenomenon. To find out why her friends and family dismissed the news that she had been sexually assaulted by someone they knew, she asks them, and records what they have to say.\n\nIn this limited five part series, you’ll hear those conversations. You’ll learn why her friends did what they did. Their answers are personal and painful, but they paint a broader picture of how rape culture works, how pervasive it is, and the damage it can do.",
