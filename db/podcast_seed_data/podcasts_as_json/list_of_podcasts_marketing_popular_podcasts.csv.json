After a few pints and a few hours of discussion about the cutting edge of digital analytics, they realized they might have something to contribute back to the community. This podcast is one of those contributions.

Big companies like Netflix, Amazon, Apple and traditional companies like Walmart are jumping on this too.\n\nBut so are thousands of others - and they’re doing it by shifting to a recurring revenue model.\n\nMeaning, more entrepreneurs than ever before have found a way to incorporate a membership or monthly subscription into their business model - and it’s transforming the way they operate forever.\n\nNo longer do they feel the pressure and stress of having to find new customers every single month. Instead, they just take care of the people who already bought from them and the monthly, recurring revenue keeps building month after month.\n\nSo how are they doing it? How are they marketing their membership sites? How are they keeping their members happy and paying month after month? And how have they built an incredibly tight bond with their tribe and online community?\n\nThat's what our show host Shelli Varela explores in this podcast.\n\nYou'll hear from people building low-stress membership business in just about every niche market you can think of. From photography and calligraphy to dog training, music, art, fitness, well being, self-improvement, blogging, interior decorating, day trading, meal planning, lesson planning and so many more.\n\nYou'll hear from authors, speakers, coaches, consultants, influencers, teachers and business owners who are all leveraging their existing knowledge and influence and transforming it into passive monthly income.\n\nThis isn't luck. There is a repeatable formula for producing a growing subscription income… and we'll show you what it is within the episodes of this show.\n\nSo if you're thinking you'd like to have your own source of recurring revenue each month or, you already have a membership site that you want to take to the next level, subscribe to this show today. Each week, your host, Shelli Varela, will be breaking down their success and uncovering the real story of how they did it… and how you can too!\n\nThe Recurring Revolution is here… the question is, will you be part of it?

        "description": "Millennials are not drinking wine as they were expected , per the 2019 Wine Industry Report by SVB. A later SVB blog also mentioned that “We [the wine industry] need to evolve the way we sell and market wine to include the young consumer as well. There is no choice.” The Wine Marketing Podcast addresses how to get more new customers and how to sell more to existing ones by using digital marketing strategies and tactics that are widely underused in the industry. From social media marketing using Facebook and Instagram, to email marketing, e-commerce and sales funnels to chatbots, conversational marketing and personalization. We have educational sessions and interviews with members of the wine industry to analyze what works and what doesn't, when it comes to marketing in the 21st century.",
