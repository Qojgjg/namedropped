        "description": "Deadly Manners is a 10 episode, dark comedy murder-mystery series set in the winter of 1954. It follows the events during the night of the affluent Billings family annual dinner party with their distinguished, eccentric guests. However, all is not fun and games as shortly after the party starts, a snowstorm begins to rage outside, trapping all the partygoers inside their host’s mansion. When a murderer starts killing off those in attendance, the guests must figure out who is responsible, or at least how to stay alive -- lest they be next.\n\nDeadly Manners was created by Ali Garfinkel and Alex Aldea.\n\nDeadly Manners stars Kristen Bell, Denis O'Hare, Alisha Boe, RuPaul, Anna Chlumsky, Timothy Simons, Michelle Visage, Alona Tal, David Cummings and is narrated by LeVar Burton.\n\nArtwork by Kina Lee.",

(People in Ankh-Morpork, by the way, look at both spelling and punctuation as optional. Those who can read and write, that is.) From there, every week the Portal will cover some of the races, places, faces, characteristics and phenomena of that world and mirror of worlds, The Discworld. That’s basically it. Your host, The Medieval Gnome, has been described as having the perfect radio face. He is also a somewhat notorious birdwalker. No, not birdwatcher. Birdwalker. Not a lot of people know how to do the latter. I on the other hand have never birdwalked. You can reach me at randy@mindkindle.net with questions or comments or suggestions about the show. That is also the email to use if you would like to make a one-time PayPal contribution to the show in any amount. If you’re a real fan of the show, please consider getting a subscription to the show through Patreon. You can use this URL to find the Discworld Portal Patreon page. https://www.patreon.com/user?u=21210045 Alternatively, you can just go to patreon and search for the show. Subscription tiers are $5, $10 and $15 per month with goodies stacked in each tier. The Portal also maintains not one but two Discord servers. the first one is a chat channel called \"Friends of the Discworld Portal.\" The second is a channel for suggestions, comments, criticisms and, well, feedback. It's called \"Portal Feedback.\" Any and all are welcome to come join either server. No animals are harmed, ever, in the making of this show. We support and encourage our listeners to commit a random act of kindness every week. The Discworld Portal is dedicated to the memory of Sir Terry Pratchett, O.B.E. Il miglior fabbro. In fact, probably no one will ever be able to fabbro as miglior as Sir Terry did. And remember boys and girls: the Turtle really does move.",
