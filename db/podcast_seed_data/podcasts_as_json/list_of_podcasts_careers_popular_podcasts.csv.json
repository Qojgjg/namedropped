Mark’s breakthrough came when he developed a marketing strategy for promoting and selling his books. His swift success enabled him to quit his 9 to 5 job and he has generated gross revenues of more than a million dollars in less than five years. \n\n\n\nMark has become a leading voice in the self publishing industry and he advocates and teaches a strategy based around offering books for free, mailing list development and social media advertising. In 2015, he published the first version of what is now his acclaimed online course ‘Advertising for Authors’. He has also developed a course for writers at the start of their careers – Self Publishing 101.\n\n\n\nJames Blatch co-hosts the podcast and he represents the first time, wannabe author. James is a former BBC News journalist who is currently writing his first novel.\n\n\n\nBetween them James and Mark explore the world of self publishing with a focus on actionable tips for new and experienced indie authors.",

Desperate to land enough clients just to pay the bills, she was disappointed at how difficult it was to find real tactical advice that would help actually her get paid month to month. The Get Paid Podcast is Claire’s attempt to pull back the curtain on the reality of running an online business. All these people pulling in “six figures” - how are they ACTUALLY doing it? What kind of money do they take home after expenses? What are those expenses, anyway? Are they truly “solopreneurs” or are they supported by a team? What does that team do for them? How are they marketing their offerings and growing their lists? How long did it take to get to where they are?  You’ll discover how different entrepreneurs get paid and what it costs them to bring in that money.",

Current episodes are educational snippets from Q&A with our corporate teams. They're usually questions we get in our StrengthsFinder corporate training sessions. As of December, 2018, over 20 Million people have taken the CliftonStrengths assessment. \n\nIt sounds silly, yet it happens all the time when people get focused on fixing their weaknesses.  It doesn't have to be so hard. Stop focusing on what's broken about you. Lisa Cummings, the host, is a Gallup Certified Strengths Performance Coach, so she brings you a wealth of corporate wisdom, combined with Gallup research.\n\nYou'll learn how to find your strengths and put them to work. If you manage a team, you'll hear ideas for leading your so your colleagues can come to work feeling more energized and engaged.\n\nIf you're ready to get your career mojo back, Lisa Cummings delivers it with straight talk and a fun-loving approach. \n\nWe publish by season. \n\nSeason 1: Career Q&A\nSeason 2: Strengths Interviews\nSeason 3: StrengthsFinder Q&A (also known as CliftonStrengths assessment) \nSeason 4: Team Building 12 Week Strengths Challenge\nSeason 5:  One StrengthsFinder Talent Theme Per Week: Career Branding Adjectives for your personal brand, red flag situations for that talent theme, and action items to put that talent to use\n\nThere's a lot of confusion about the name of the assessment because it is difficult to spell (or put the singular/plural in the right spot), and it has changed names. All of these are the same survey tool: StrengthsFinder 2.0, StrengthsFinders, StrengthFinders, StrengthFinder, StrengthsFinder, Clifton Strengths, CliftonStrengths, Clifton StrengthsFinder.\n\nDespite the difficulty with the word, the content all points to Strengths Based Development and leadership using StrengthsFinder with your team. \n\nIn addition: here are some hot topic areas covered by audience questions so far:\nGetting promoted; \ndiscovering your strengths; \ndifferentiating yourself; \ncoaching and feedback;\nmarketing, branding, and promoting yourself; \ngetting unstuck; \ndeveloping your direct reports;\nnoticing what works on your team;\nconnecting and networking; \npersonal leadership; \npolitics and perceptions at the office; \ngetting viewed as an A player; \nbuilding trust and influence at work or in your industry; \nbeing a people-leader that you want to be, even when you're short on time;\nhow to get your creative mojo back; \nunderstanding how your EQ (emotional intelligence) is more important than your IQ at work; \nstuff you didn't learn in business school that's hurting your career; getting unstuck and un-trapped; \nand being a better leader",

        "description": "Your customer needs a hero. Will you answer the call?\n\nThe Buyer's Mind with Jeff Shore is a B2C sales training podcast dedicated to helping you increase your sales numbers by understanding your customers in a deeper way. Whether you’re buying a magazine, a mobile phone, a new car or a new home, we all go through surprisingly similar thought patterns during a purchase cycle. Jeff’s podcast is about the psychology behind those thought patterns—the obvious and subtle considerations that lead someone to buy (or often not buy) a product. What sets Jeff apart from other sales trainers in his field is a continued focus on the experience of the the buyer, not the seller. \n\nIn addition to his weekly podcast, Jeff Shore is a highly sought-after sales expert, speaker, author and entrepreneur. He is the CEO and founder of Shore Consulting which offers a variety of B2C sales training events throughout the United States. His sales training programs teach sales professionals to abandon scripted sales presentations, obnoxious closing lines and other antiquated “used car salesman” techniques in order to make meaningful, emotion-centered connections with their customers. These sales strategies have proven incredibly successful: last year alone, Jeff’s residential real estate sales training clients sold over $25 billion in residential real estate.\n\nAre you are a sales manager or executive looking for ways to increase profits and grow your company by updating outdated sales techniques and increasing the leadership and decision making skills of your staff? Are you a front line sales professional simply looking to master the art of persuasion? The Buyer’s Mind was designed for you. Learn more. Earn more. Enjoy your life more!",

        "description": "Welcome to the Doctor Money Matters podcast. \n\n\n\nI am your host Dr. Tarang Patel, a practicing diagnostic radiologist in Phoenix, AZ. \n\n\n\nI started this podcast as a way to share knowledge about financial matters as they relate to health care professionals. We spent many years learning about the science and art of providing patient care but most of us have relatively little knowledge about reaching financial well being. I know that I had no formal training in setting up investment accounts, negotiating contracts, buying insurance, buying real estate, etc. I just learned by reading and also by making many mistakes. Health care professionals are trusted to take put their patients needs first and we in turn assume everyone in other fields work the same way. Unfortunately this is not always true. \n\n\n\nBy talking about these topics, I hope we can reduce the many financial mistakes that prior generations of doctors have made.  Those physicians were able to overcome these mistakes because of shorter training periods, less debt, and they were more likely to be in private practice. Today we no longer have those luxuries and many of us have significant debt burdens. The good news is that we also have access to information that the prior generation never had. \n\n\n\nA little background about me. As I said before I am a practicing radiologist in Phoenix, AZ. I went to undergrad at Indiana U. (Go Hoosiers), medical school at the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine (Now AT Still Univ) in Missouri, moved east and did my radiology residency at New York Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. I then moved west to serve my Air Force commitment at Nellis AFB in Las Vegas, NV. I then did a fellowship in Body/Musculoskeletal Imaging at Mayo Clinic Arizona. Since I finished training I have been in a hospital employed group for the last 6 years.\n\n\n\nI have always enjoyed learning about finance and have read (listened to) many of the financial books. I also spent time reading on the bogleheads.org forum which I found to be a valuable source of information. Finally I just observed that many of my colleagues and I had the same questions about relatively basic financial matters but it was difficult to find clear answers.\n\n\n\nHopefully you find these podcasts useful. I encourage you to subscribe to them, that way you will be updated when any episodes are released automatically. Also please let your friends and colleagues know about this podcast. \n\n\n\nPlease give us good feedback on iTunes, Google Play and stitcher and if you have suggestions on topics or how to improve the podcast please send your emails to comments@doctormoneymatters.com \n\nSocial media links:\n\ntwitter @drmoneymatters\n\nFacebook www.facebook.com/doctormoneymatters/\n\n\n\nPlease understand that this show is for entertainment and education only and you should do your own research and speak with the appropriate experts prior to making any changes in regards to material you may have heard on the show.

Yet you still think to yourself “Everyone thinks I’m much smarter than I really am. I feel like I’m faking it.”\nMany smart and successful people have a great resume with a long list of accomplishments. But they doubt their own skills and dismiss their own success.   \nIt's the Impostor Syndrome, a secret self-doubt that is especially prevalent in technical and creative fields. This causes qualified and talented people to feel anxious, overwhelmed and isolated, all while performing exceptionally well. They fear that success is so fragile that it could evaporate at any moment, and people will see them as some type of fraud. \nIt’s estimated that 70% of people suffer from this. But by changing your thinking, you can begin to enjoy your success, be proud of your abilities, confidently face new opportunities without fear of being unmasked as a fake. You’ll experience a new freedom when you begin to break free from the clench of the counterfeit.\n\nMaureen Zappala, a former NASA propulsion researcher (yes, she's a rocket scientist!) explores this topic of self-doubt and Imposter syndrome, while explaining strategies to take you from self-doubt to self-confidence. You can match your confidence to your competence and unleash your influence.",
