The show follows the plot and characters wherever they lead, through many surprising twists and turns. Sarah won't know what happens at the end of the story until she gets there, not long before you get there with her. Each week she'll bring you the latest chapter, so it's important to listen in, starting with Episode 1. New episodes are released on Thursday mornings.",

From its heyday as Motor City to its rebirth as the Brooklyn of the Midwest, Detroit’s history reflects a series of issues that strike at the heart of American identity: race, poverty, policing, loss of industry, the war on drugs, and our universal desire for a savior. Detroit’s a tough town, and its residents are even tougher. They’ve weathered riots, a drug epidemic, political scandal, and innumerable other hardships, but they’re still here—and they have stories to tell.",

It's a smart, unique (and admittedly U.S.-centric) program that doesn't dumb down the information or analysis for the slowest person in the room.\n\nCarlin's rapid-fire staccato voice has been compared to William Shatner after too many espressos. That, plus his penchant for making everyone in the audience mad at him eventually, makes for a witch's brew of a podcast that is not for everyone. But for those craving a deeper intellectual analysis, a less partisan approach and unpredictable outside-the-box revelations, Common Sense with Dan Carlin is a feast for the mind.",

In our seventh season, we examine the deadly police shooting of Afghanistan war veteran Anthony Hill. Hill was not only unarmed when he was gunned down in March 2015, he was naked. The 26-year-old was struggling with bipolar disorder and was off his medication. But Police Officer Chip Olsen didn’t know that when he responded to a 911 call about a nude man wandering around a metro Atlanta apartment complex in the middle of the afternoon. \n\nThe AJC's Breakdown podcast is just that — the breakdown of the story and the systems. The largest newsroom in the southeast delivers investigations and true crime cases that you cannot find anywhere else.",

From Russian plots to interfere in our election to constitutional questions of executive power, the Mueller Report is potentially one of the most important and consequential documents of our time. But there's a problem. Very few people have read it.\nThere is still so much confusion about the Report. What it says, who it implicates, and what it means for our country. At Lawfare, we are distilling the report into a multi part audio narrative series, telling you the story of what is in this document, the story Mueller wants you to understand.\nWe are grateful to the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Democracy Fund for their support for this project.\n\nProduced by Goat Rodeo.\nwww.goatrodeodc.com\n\nLawfare\nwww.lawfareblog.com",

With each season of Shattered, we select one of those complex, true stories and take an in-depth look.\n\nSeason 4 charts the life and death of Jimmy Hoffa.\n\nSeason 3 tells the story of a string of murders that took place in the mid-1970s in Oakland County, Michigan. Many people know the case as the Oakland County Child Killer. \n\nSeason 2 tells the story of Rick Wershe Jr.,  also known as White Boy Rick. At 14, Rick became the youngest FBI informant ever and helped bring down some of Detroit’s biggest drug dealers.  Then the FBI abandoned him, and he became the dealer.\n\nSeason 1 investigates the disappearance of Andrew, Alexander and Tanner Skelton. The boys’ father, John Skelton, is the main suspect. Almost a decade later, the mystery of what happened to the boys remains open, with their small Michigan hometown wondering - could a father have committed an unimaginable crime?",

Is Western Civilization doomed? Is nationalism the wave of the future? Is the Pope Catholic? Will they ever find a new place to put cheese on a pizza? Is Die Hard a Christmas movie? Who is hotter: Ginger or Mary-Ann? Was Plato really endorsing the Republic as the ideal state?

The shooting of Laquan McDonald was captured on video, and sparked outrage across the city. Chicago's top cop was fired, the local state’s attorney was voted out, and the feds were sent in to investigate the culture at the police department. Now, the police officer at the center of the shooting, Jason Van Dyke, will stand trial for murder. WBEZ and the Chicago Tribune look at how Van Dyke and McDonald intersected that night nearly four years ago, the alleged cover-up of the shooting, and examine the long history of friction between African-Americans and the Chicago Police Department. And we’ll follow the trial — bringing you insight, context, and analysis.",

On July 25, 2019, with the 2020 election around the corner, he decided to do it again.\nThe first time around, it was collusion, aiding and abetting Russia’s attack on American democracy. The second time, it was extortion, demanding the Ukrainian government manufacture dirt on Trump’s political opponents in exchange for help the country needs to fend off a Russian invasion and chart a democratic future free of Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin.  \nTo make sense of these recent events that have rocked American politics and led to very real concerns that the President of the United States may be a Russian asset, we need to dig a little deeper. \nIn Season 1, The Asset dives into Trump’s decades-long history with Russia, from his extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs to his presidential campaign and the investigations that have sent some of his closest associates to prison.\nIn Season 2, The Asset explores the backstory to Trump’s infamous phone call with the newly-elected Ukrainian President, where he demanded an investigation into a political opponent and set off a series of events leading to the impeachment inquiry.\nHosted by Max Bergmann, a senior fellow and director of the Moscow Project at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, and featuring expert guests, The Asset will put together the pieces of Trump’s relationship with Russia and Ukrainian extortion campaign.\nThe Asset is a partnership between the Center for American Progress Action Fund, District Productive, and Protect the Investigation. It is produced by Paul Woodhull, a 20-year veteran media executive and president of Build Better Media, and Peter Ogburn, the executive producer of the Bill Press Show.",

        "description": "Scott Adams is best known as the creator of the Dilbert comic strip. But in his daily (sometimes twice daily) podcasts, Adams uses his training as a hypnotist and a lifelong student of persuasion to analyse current events (mostly Trump-related) through a persuasion lense. In so doing, Adams offers you a new way to understand your reality. You can also expect to pick up some valuable persuasion techniques along the way.\n\n\n\nThese podcasts are the audio channels from Adams' popular Periscope videos. If you hear pauses and interruptions, Adams is probably reading comments as they come across his Periscope screen. Adams' Periscope listeners requested that he convert the Periscope videos into podcast files so they can be played offline and also use less battery power.\n\n\n\nMost of what you will hear is spontaneous, unrehearsed and casual. The best way to listen is while sipping your favorite beverage.",
