        "description": "Mission Log is a Roddenberry Entertainment podcast with the sole purpose of exploring the Star Trek universe one episode at a time.  That’s right, this podcast will cover six different series and 30 seasons of television by journeying into every one of the 726 episodes with a single mission: to explore, debate and discuss one of the largest science fiction phenomena of all time, Star Trek. \n\nStarting with The Original Series’ initial pilot and continuing chronologically until we reach the last episode of Star Trek: Enterprise, each week our hosts, Ken Ray and John Champion, will tackle a single episode, delving into the most historical and hysterical science fiction that Star Trek has to offer.  Along with a variety of guests and interviews, Mission Log will attempt to reach Star Trek’s ethical subtext, understand it’s complex metaphors and finally figure out what was the trouble with those tribbles.\n\nExplore strange new details.  Seek out new perspectives; deeper understandings. Boldly go where so many of us love to go, again and again.  Join us for Mission Log!",

        "description": "Hold onto your Chelsea buns! Kimberly and Katie, from A Date with Dateline, are branching out from their usual crime and punishment rough stuff to a more delicious type of rough puff. For this series we are delighting in the return of The Great British Bake Off, with sugar dusted recaps and discussion with just a pinch of snark. Not too much snark or you’ll have a snarky bottom. We're dishing on all the things you love about Bake Off— the properly British, mostly disguised (but sometimes not) innuendo, Noel’s perfect comic timing and choice of sweaters, and the always heart-stopping Hollywood handshake, usually following one or ten of his disapproving death stares. Join us in acting like we know what we’re talking about when it comes to flour choices (isn't semolina a country?), proving times for a proper loaf, and praising bakers along the way for their use of bold spices like our palettes might well be just as refined as the mighty Prue. What is a claggy frangipane genoise, you might ask, and am I in the emergency room or a patisserie if I am having one? Never fear, all the mysteries of pastry will be revealed in...no, no they won't. But, that's why we are on the couch and not in the Bake Off tent. If you love American professional amateur podcasters intently watching a group of amateur British bakers compete in a competition for the glory of national pride and a really heavy looking cake platter trophy with both really just earnestly doing their best then this is the home for you. Fire up the ovens, er... earbuds and on your mark, get set... It’s A DATE WITH THE BAKE!",

With familiar faces from the franchise returning— including Riker, Troi, Data, Seven of Nine, and Hugh, the first Borg to display individuality, the new show promises to advance the Star Trek story in profound ways. This new addition to the Trek.fm family of podcasts, hosted by Justin Oser, Brandon-Shea Mutala, and Chrissie De Clerck-Szilagyi, explores the character of Picard in the lead-up to the premier and will take you deep into each episode of the new series as it airs. Subshows, such as Tracks on the Line with Mike Schindler and Max Hegel, will further enhance the experience of welcoming back one Star Trek’s most beloved characters.",

If you love cartoons, if exquisite animation and cool ships and aliens and tightly crafted plotting and emotional drama are everything you could ever want out of your cartoons, you owe it to yourself to absorb this series - and ours, since that's what we're doing. \n\nAnd if you have seen it? FANTASTIC. Here's a good reason to watch it again.\n\nFrom the creative voices/loudmouths behind Return to the Past: A Code Lyoko Retrospective comes - that's right - a full second recap/rewatch podcast about a French animated cartoon from the early-mid 2000s co-created by Thomas Romain. Join Mary and David as they revisit and share a show that is incredibly powerful and special to them, and Ben as he watches it for pretty much the first time! \n\nThis will be a spoiler-free podcast up to the current episode. You can watch along with us through the Oban: Star Racers DVDs, or purchase the digital copies on Youtube or Amazon!\n\n===\n\nFollow us on Twitter at @super_nuclear, or send us your feedback at supernucleargroup@gmail.com! Or you can support us on Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/supernucleargroup .\n\nCover art by Zhampy!

They journey into the “TARDIS archives” each episode to look at how classic Doctor adventures helped pave the way to contemporary stories. Join Time and Space as Jessica and Phillip explore their love of “Doctor Who,” and, occasionally, for each other.",

        "description": "There are hundreds of Doctor Who episodes and stories out there and we intend to watch them all! Not just that – We’ll watch, review, discuss, debate, rate and praise and/or poke holes in every episode of Doctor Who, starting with the 1963 pilot. That’s right; we’re beginning with William Hartnell and then working our way forward through time, episode by episode and Doctor by Doctor. In parallel, we're also reviewing New Who, starting with Eccleston in the 2005 revival. At the time of writing this, we're already well into the Tom Baker and Matt Smith eras!\n\nFrom comparing Dalek and Cybermen military strategems to ranking companions by hairstyle, we’ve got it covered. And while you subscribe to us on iTunes, we’re populating WhoBackWhen.com with written reviews, episode statistics and an ever-growing visual index of aliens, creatures, historical figures and companions that the Doctor meets along the way.",
