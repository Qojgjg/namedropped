I will chat with each guest about what really led them to blogging, why they blog, what inspires them, what blogging has brought them, for example book deals, designing fabric and patterns, working with other companies. We will also talk about their passions that fuel their blogs like sewing, crafting, cooking, home improvement, and parenting. It is a chance to get to know them a little more than what we read on their blogs and just have a great time chatting. If you would like to suggest a modern creative blogger you would like to see interviewed on the podcast just email me at themodernsewciety (at) gmail (dot) com. Enjoy!",

Build Your House Yourself University (byhyu) will teach you to save money and make smart decisions about the construction of the place you and your family will call HOME. We will help you understand residential construction— simplify and demystify the design build process. You’ll come away with successful strategies for building your own house, with or without a general contractor.  \n\nBecome an educated consumer, even if you prefer to buy, rather than build a new house. Complex construction jargon and best practices will be explained in easy to understand terms.  It’s not the typical DIY (do it yourself) show.  You will learn how to MANAGE the labor, not DO the labor for your new house.\n\nJoin me, Michelle Nelson, host and fellow informal residential construction student.  I’ll share the research I find on home design and building as I prepare to build my home. Together, our community of future home builders, will learn the tips, tricks and trends of experienced contractors and industry experts. \n\nI’ll interview owner-builders and construction professionals.  During our mini lessons, I’ll inform you about framing, flooring, windows, insulation, kitchen cabinets and countertops…almost anything having to do with new construction homes.  You’ll hear about energy efficiency and green building too.  There will be product reviews in which you will be introduced to cutting edge, as well as, tried and true products and services.  And in keeping with the university theme, episodes will end with short, fun quizzes. \n\nIf we do our due diligence BEFORE we start construction, we will actually start construction with the most difficult part of the project behind us.  Let’s put in the time, effort, preparation and research BEFORE we break ground and building our homes will be much easier and more enjoyable.",

In early 2006 I took on a project I call Everyday Paintings, which was what I thought would be a daunting but doable goal of painting a new painting everyday, making them competent paintings, beautiful and hopefully valuable. Believing that something is only as valuable as what someone is willing to pay for it, I determined to test the market using solely eBay for sales, and along the way, building a list of contacts who are interested in my work.\n\nSince I do good work, and a day of good work ought to be worth at least $100, I start each auction with a minimum bid of $100. \n\nTo be added to my FREE Everyday Paintings mailing list (you will receive a small picture via e-mail of each new painting I do, plus notification of any new Paintcast™), please visit my Everyday Paintings site: http://www.everydaypaintings.com . There is a sign-up box on the right column.\n\nYou can read all about me and my art background at http://www.DarrowArt.com (my larger, older website), and by reading my personal blog there.

We’ll be finding and discussing graphic design subjects in all forms using words like branding, color theory, hierarchy, fonts, and other terms you may or may not use every day. One has questions, the other likely has answers. We will talk about everything from the special edition poster you bought at that one concert to your cousin who thinks they’re a designer just cause they own Photoshop. We want to share what keeps us creative and motivated by talking about music, pop culture, cool places, and basically whatever we feel is relevant. So sit back, relax, and listen to us speak our minds (and we hope to hear you speak yours too).",
