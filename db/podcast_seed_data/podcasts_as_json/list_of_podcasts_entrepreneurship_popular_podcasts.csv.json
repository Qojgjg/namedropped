Learn to overcome fear, failure and adversity by developing a new mindset. Sam Crowley is an ex-corporate slave who wanted one thing, to be a father. It sounds so simple until you realize that he was beholden to his employer, giving his direct reports at work all of his energy, while giving his family the left overs. All of that changed when Sam’s daughter asked “Daddy is tomorrow Saturday?” She asked him that because she wanted every day to be like the one day they saw each other. Sam quit his job and made the leap to being a speaker and podcaster. The Every Day Is Saturday podcast has been downloaded over 16 million times in over 100 countries. Go ahead and dive in. However, be careful. Sam has a unique way of getting you to take massive action towards your very own Saturday. Let’s get fired up!",

Sales is the most important department in every company but many sellers are never taught how to effectively sell, much less how to earn their way to high-income status. My own career limped along until a company I worked for invested in sales training to help me succeed. Immediately afterward, I closed a deal worth 4X what the company spent on me and saw hockey-stick improvement in my performance. So I started a podcast to “Evangelize” what was working. \n\n\nToday I interview the world's best sales experts, successful sellers, sales leaders and entrepreneurs who share their strategies to succeed in sales right now: folks like Jeffrey Gitomer, Jill Konrath, Bob Burg, and Guy Kawasaki to name a few. They share actionable insights and stories that will encourage, challenge, and motivate you to hustle your way to top income status.

Those among us who can’t turn it off, and don’t know why anyone would want to. We challenge complacency, destroy apathy, and we are obsessed with creating momentum. \n\nWhile the rest of the world strives for average and clings desperately to the status quo, you and I are compelled to move forward and change the world. \n\nWe are the minority, the few, who are willing to hallucinate there could be a better future. Instead of just daydreaming of what could be, we endure the vulnerability and exposure it takes to make it real. We are the evolutionary hunters. The most important people in the world because entrepreneurs are the only source of consistent, positive human evolution, and we always will be.",

        "description": "Hi, we're Jacqueline and Minna. We created \"The Product Boss Podcast\" out of our own struggles. In a sea of service-based advice, we needed more marketing, visibility and sales strategies that were specific to product entrepreneurs - to connect, grow, inspire and lift each other up in our businesses and lives. We want you to know: You are not alone. As product entrepreneurs, we speak the same language: production, manufacturing, handmade collections, raw goods, cost of goods, shipping, fulfillment, tradeshows, gross profit, revenue, retail, sales promotions and wholesale. Topics that service-based business owners don't have to think about or worry about in their businesses. We've been there and we've got you covered! Each week, we share our product expertise, as biz besties and product coaches, in a workshop-style, marketing school format episode. Topics include social media strategies, ecommerce sales and promotions, juggling life being a boss and mom, female business ownership in this ever-changing online world. Grow your online presence and revenue: E-commerce business sales channels, gaining SEO and perpetual traffic to your website, leverage platforms (Amazon seller, Shopify and Etsy) and how to tackle wholesale, creative small business marketing ideas, productivity hacks, content planning, product blogging, and entrepreneurial mindset and growth. And, last but not least, how to create an amazing life and build the business you dream of, whether you're a start-up, 6-figure business or millionaire mom. Is it possible to create passive income and multiple streams of revenue in the product world?  Can you make your physical product or private label business a full-time income from a side hustle? Can makers take their handmade items and manufacture in a smart way to scale their businesses and handle teams, inventory and production without losing your special touch?  Join us every Thursday!",

Serial entrepreneur Jessica Herrin, Founder & CEO of Stella & Dot Family of Brands, shares an unfiltered perspective on her windy road towards success, obstacles faced, mistakes made, opportunities seized and challenges overcome. From mediocre student waitressing her way through community college and Stanford Business School drop out, Jessica bootstrapped her way to success, first as the co-founder of the company that became WeddingChannel.com -- a business that was commercially successful but didn’t leave her soulfully fulfilled. Out of the living room of her home, while working full time and pregnant with her first child, Jessica launched her next company, Stella & Dot, with a mission: To give women the opportunity to earn with flexibility and define success on their own terms. Today, she is at the helm of a company that has sold over $1 billion in products in fashion and beauty, and most importantly, helped women earn over $500 million in flexible income and own their destiny. Expanding on the lessons shared in her bestselling book, Find Your Extraordinary, Jessica, our coach, mentor, and mom of two invites women to participate in a weekly dialogue with the simple goal to help you rise in their own life. Jessica shares her personal point of view, lessons learned across a range of business and life topics and delves into the downright comical and imperfect tales of her own Self Made journey. Jessica will take things one step further and tap into her network of successful business leaders and gurus to share their insights on the journey towards success, pose important questions for us all to consider and offer make-it-happen advice. Self Made is for people who love to hustle, want more out of life, refuse to sacrifice too much to succeed -- whether professionally, personally or both -- and are looking for the mojo and actions they need to go out and make their own lives exactly what they want. Have a topic or question you want Jessica to talk about? Reach out to askjessicapodcast@stelladot.com she would love to hear from you. Love the show?

Join Dr. Caneel Joyce each week as she partners with your own creative genius - the true artist within you - to allow you to seek out and reclaim the wholeness that is your birthright and a life that showcases and celebrates all of who you are - your true essence.

I am a 5th degree black belt in Jiu-Jitsu, a Certified High Performance Coach and the founder of the BJJ Mental Coach movement. The idea behind the BJJ Mental Coach was to create a program designed to help you to discover the negative patterns that might be holding you back from being your authentic self on the mat and how to deal with the issue, and the cool thing is that consequently it will reflect on but also off the mat as well, in your personal and professional life. And in this podcast we go there, we go BEYOND THE MAT. This podcast is dedicated to a selective group of entrepreneurs, small business owners and/or aspiring entrepreneurs, who train jiu-jitsu and want to take their mindset to an even higher level, on and off the mat. Every Monday, our guests, who also happen to train in Jiu-Jitsu, will share with you their failures, their successes, the mindset and habits of successful high-performers, plus provide you with valuable content on Entrepreneurship, Personal Development & BJJ that will help you during your entrepreneurial journey. Our mission is to inspire YOU, a Jiu-Jitsu practitioner, an entrepreneur and/or aspiring entrepreneur, to take your mindset to an even higher level, to consistently accept and embrace new challenges in your life, and to consistently pursue your journey of becoming the best version of yourself. So, if you’re committed to growing, evolving, not only as an business person, a Jiu-Jitsu practitioner, but also as a human being… The BJJ Mental Coach Podcast is for you!",

The Startup Pregnant Podcast features interviews with pioneering women entrepreneurs, exceptional leaders, and new parents as they navigate what it takes to grow families and build companies. We ask deep human questions around what it means to become a parent, grow a business, deal with success, and learn from failure. These are profound, life-transforming journeys. This show isn’t strictly about startups and pregnancy; it’s about the deep-rooted power that growing businesses and babies taps into, and how we change as a result. Throughout both “Startup” and “Pregnant” viewpoints, we look at what it means to undergo these profound internal transformations that come with creating new things from scratch. By telling both personal narratives and stories, we guide a larger conversation about femininity, energy, creativity, and leadership. Transformation isn’t easy, in fact, it’s often painful, but it’s one of the most beautiful parts of being a human.",

If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by the number of projects and tasks you're juggling, you’ve come to the right podcast!

It all started with a failed training to scale my business with actual employees. I had to re-evaluate everything I did in my business and that's when I made the conscious decision to move away from an employee biz model to a VA (virtual assistant) biz model.This became the defining moment of my career.I couldn't be happier! I no longer go to the office. I no longer have to deal with the headaches of employees (let's be real)... AND now I have 7-10 VA's for the price of what was 1 employee!",

Take a journey of motivation, growth and transformation of your legal nurse consulting practice by learning from successful entrepreneurs. Boost your skills by getting valuable tips from experts from within and outside of legal nurse consulting. In this show I provide two types of podcasts. The first is an interview with an expert who reveals key concepts you may apply to your legal nurse consulting practice. The experts answer probing questions to give you practical tips you can immediately apply. In the second type of podcast, I offer my comments, experience, and lessons learned the hard way to expand on what the interview covered. Here’s what you can expect to get from listening to these programs: tips and strategies, encouragement, sound advice, and more. My podcasts cover what I consider to the 5 pillars of legal nurse consulting. •\tFirst you need expertise in your medical knowledge so that you can help clients. •\tSecond, you need to have marketing skills and use strategies that will bring you clients. •\tThird, you need to follow sound financial practices to collect and wisely spend your dollars. •\tFourth, you need to know how to work with clients to strengthen relationships. •\tLastly, you need to know how to manage a business. I’ll summarize: The 5 pillars are expertise, marketing, finances, clients and business management. You may listen to Legal Nurse Podcasts on my website at legalnursepodcasts.com or on Itunes. I know some people prefer to listen to information and some prefer to read.If you like to read or to be able to refer again what you’ve just heard, you may request the transcripts of the programs. Get the transcripts on legalnursepodcasts.com. Here’s who I am. I started as an LNC in 1987 when I got my first expert witness case. I spent about 20 years as a medical surgical nursing expert witness testifying in nursing malpractice cases. Also, I spent over 25 years summarizing medical records to explain the facts to juries. In 1989 I started an independent legal nurse consultant business and built it up to become a large and successful business. I sold it in 2015. Along the way I committed 5 years of my life to the American Association of Legal Nurse Consultants, including a year as president. Since I sold my business, I have been writing, editing books, presenting webinars and coaching LNCs. My coaching site is LNCAcademy.com. I love to write, as you will discover when you go to legalnursebusiness.com, my website for LNCs. Many LNCs know me as the chief editor of the second edition of the Legal Nurse Consulting Principles and Practices. It is one of my hundreds of publications, including books, chapters, articles, case studies and online courses. I bring all of this expertise to you. I’d love to hear your thoughts about this show. Let me know what YOU are interested in hearing about. Add your comments to the episode show notes on legalnursepodcasts.com. Thank you for joining us.",
