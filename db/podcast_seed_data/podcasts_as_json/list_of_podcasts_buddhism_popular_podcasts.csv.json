He now offers teachings freely to all in a manner that is unpretentious and clear. He does not demand students to blindly accept what he says, but instead invites them to examine their own minds and experiences to discover the validity of Gautama Buddha’s teachings. \n\nYeshe quietly demonstrates Gautama Buddha’s teaching on compassion through the charitable trust ‘Sangye Menla’ that he founded in 2008 in Chandigarh, Northern India. The trust provides medical assistance and care to people from the Himalayan region in India.",

This is an approach to recovery that understands: “All individuals have the power and potential to free themselves from the suffering that is caused by addiction.” We feel confident in the power of the Dharma, if applied, to relieve suffering of all kinds, including the suffering of addiction. This is a process that cultivates a path of awakening, the path of recovering from the addictions and delusions that have created so much suffering in our lives and in this world.\n\nRefuge Recovery is a systematic approach to training our hearts and minds to see clearly and respond to our lives with understanding and non-harming. You are entering a way of life that may be familiar to some and foreign to others. In the beginning some of it may seem confusing or counter-instinctual, and some of it is. But you will find that with time, familiarity and experience, it will all make perfect sense and will gradually become a more and more natural way of being.",

Goenka, and, most recently, Matt Flickstein.\n\nAfter many requests, we've arranged to post the Wednesday night Buddhist meditation group into podcast format. We hope you find them beneficial.",

        "description": "Do you want to stop drinking? Does alcoholism or addiction run in your family? Are you considering how to get sober? Are you seriously thinking about sobriety for the first time being alcohol is controlling your life as never before? Has the idea of a \"Higher Power\" kept you out of Alcoholics Anonymous or other 12 Step recovery programs?\n\nIf so, then check out this podcast!\n\nIn this meeting, a chapter of the Tao Te Ching is discussed every week as to how it relates to recovery. Taoist Philosophy can be a great tool for embracing the idea of a “Higher Power”. Nature offers all of the examples necessary for a concept of a source of all life, much different but yet very similar in many ways to more traditional religious thinking. Here is a link to an online version of the Tao Te Ching that we use in every meeting; https://ttc.tasuki.org/display:Year:1972,1988,1996,2004/section:1 \n\nIn the Recovery Revolution Community, RRC for short, we have a number of live online recovery meetings every week on a number of different topics led by a wide mix of addicts and alcoholics in recovery. \n\nFor more information about the RRC, go to https://omarpinto.com/membership-community/ If you join the RRC, you will not only be able to participate in this meeting, along with many more live meetings, but also access a video library of past meetings plus many more benefits of this growing community. Thanks for checking out our podcast. If you listen and enjoy this podcast, please share with your friends in recovery!",

        "description": "The Mindful Cranks  broadly explores the cultural translation of Buddhism in the West, various facets of Buddhist modernism, and the mainstreaming of mindfulness in secular contexts. The podcast serves as a forum for voices that go beyond the dominant narratives which have been thus far uncritical of  consumerism, medicalization, psychologization, corporatization and self-help approaches. Drawing from a wide range of disciplines — the humanities, philosophy, cultural studies, education, critical pyschology, religious studies, and sociology—The Mindful Cranks welcomes new conversations that challenge the priviledging of scientific materialism, methodological individualism, reductionism, and neoliberalism.  Our guests are leading edge scholars, authors, teachers, practitioners and activists that share a mutual interest in civic mindfulness and socially engaged contemplative methods.  A wide range of diverse perspectives–including critical theory, critical pedagogy, ethnography, Foucauldian governmentality, feminism, hermeneutics, critical race theory, critical management studies, socially engaged Buddhism, political economy–provide the “cranky” intellectual tools for socially engaged contemplative change.",

        "description": "This podcast started when four friends at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte began meeting to learn about each other’s religions, sometimes while reading a common book—and found such discussions so interesting that they decided to record them. One member of the group, David Bashor, was a long-time Methodist (and a biology professor). Another, Mark Pizzato (a theatre professor), had grown up Roman Catholic but was gradually converting to Buddhism. Bill Chu (originally from China and a computer science professor) was more experienced in Buddhism, though also a convert to it. Mirsad Hadzikadic (originally from Bosnia and also a computer science professor) had been raised Muslim and recently increased his adherence to its principles. All four wanted to understand how they viewed Allah, God, or Ultimate Truth in similar and different ways. They started recording these podcast episodes in spring 2015 (with Mirsad leading on the technical side, also with the help of Mark Olson). Unfortunately, David Bashor died in August of that year, from a long-term illness that suddenly worsened. So these podcasts are dedicated to his memory and fueled by his spirit, while discovering connections between science, philosophy, and various religious ideals. (David was especially interested in the scientific possibilities of “Morphic Resonance” and “Akashic Field” theories.) We three continue, with David in mind, to explore what the teachings and actions of Buddha, Jesus, and Mohammed might mean today—as recorded by their followers and later generations, in various distinctive yet resonating ways.

This Buddhist program aims to give every listener an opportunity to ponder some of life’s deepest questions such as:\n\n“Why do bad and good things happen? Is it karma? How can I overcome insecurity and start to care deeply for other beings? Can I lessen my depression and fears?  Is reincarnation real? What is the mind? Exactly what is enlightenment?\n\nA Buddhist nun since the late 1970s, Robina Courtin has worked since then with the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition, a worldwide network of Tibetan Buddhist activities of Lama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinopche. She has served as editorial director of Wisdom Publications, editor of Mandala magazine, and executive director of Liberation Prison Project. Her life, as well as her work with prisoners, has been featured in the documentary films “Chasing Buddha and Key to Freedom”.",

Spiritual adept, visionary, poet, farmer, Traktung Khepa is an American-born sage who has taught students in America, Europe, and Cuba since 1990. For 30 years he has guided Tsogyelgar, a contemplative community outside Ann Arbor, Michigan. Equally able to explore the most esoteric aspects and methods of the Tantric path or discuss Existentialism, Santeria, Alchemy, Political Philosophy, or Art History, t.k.’s style of teaching is immediate and relevant. \n\nAs a child, t.k. traveled with his parents from Marrakesh to Istanbul exploring modern and ancient cultures, museums, churches, whirling dervishes, gypsy caves, healers in the Black Forest, and mysteries of Greek ruins. As a teen he had encounters with spiritual aspirants and adepts of every sort from Jesuit priests and Franciscan monks to Krishnamurti, 32nd degree Freemasons, Sufi and Zen masters and more. At the same time he picnicked on the White House lawn with Reagan and joked with Nixon and Kissinger as they played Happy Birthday for his mother on the piano. \n\nt.k’s lifelong passion for exploring spiritual traditions and life’s meaning has seamlessly melded with his profound realization accomplished through the non-monastic Tantric path. The Adept Thinley Norbu Rinpoche repeatedly encouraged him share his wisdom and realization to, “Help Westerners clarify the inner meanings of Tantra without distortions.”",

        "description": "Sifting through the earliest records of the Buddha's talks, we find a simple, elegant, and powerful practice. When he died, his teaching became an “ism”, Buddhism. As it spread into other countries, cultures, and eras his teachings or “map” was copied and re-copied. Shortcuts and alternatives were added and deleted. Compared to the versions of his teachings most widely known, his original meditation emphasized: Tranquility: an open, receptive awareness favored over highly focused, one-pointed concentration; Simplicity: loving kindness, serenity and insight all integrated rather than treated as separate practices; Stages: the practice matures through stages, each of which builds upon and goes beyond earlier stages (or “jhana”); Ease: relaxing as more important than striving. These podcasts are dedicated to this approach to meditation and daily living. I call it “easing awake.”",

The print version was edited and published by Ajahn Amaro, and offered in dedication when the Amaravati Temple was formally opened in 1999.

The centre was established in 1980 for those in search of a practical approach to the Buddha's teaching.\nStripped of ritual and cultural accretions, the path is presented in a manner ideally suited to the needs of the modern westerner. Today, just as in the times of the Buddha, someone committed to truth can travel right to the end of the path and realise the goal of enlightenment.\nCountless talks on all aspects of the Buddha's teaching have been given at the Centre over the years. We have created these weekly podcast programmes as a way to make some of these talks available to a wider audience.",
