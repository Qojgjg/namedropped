        "description": "Alternate Ending was formed when three friends realized they all shared a passion for movies.  Our goal is to save you time and money by sharing our thoughts and recommendations on which movies to race to theaters for, which to watch at home and those to actively avoid. \n\nWhat makes Alternate Ending different from other film podcasts? Well, we’re not 5 dudes in a room talking about our passion for Fight Club and Braveheart.  We’re two dudes, and a lady, of which our tastes are quite varied.  Rob, the film-school dropout, has seen an absurd amount of movies, and if we’re being honest, rounds out our Fight Club fan-base.  Tim Brayton, our seasoned film critic, shares a more critical view of film, an appreciation for vintage cinema and perhaps limited-release movies that we might otherwise miss. Carrie, our casual movie-goer, reminds us all that cinema is in fact supposed to be fun and entertaining and that sometimes, just sometimes, happy endings are good. \n\nToo many film sites cater to the same kind of audience, with one overwhelming voice in the writing, but what we treasure at Alternate Ending is diversity: diversity of opinion, diversity in belief about what film should do and how it should do it. We want to celebrate our different opinions, and celebrate yours as well. \n\nThis isn't a podcast for people who just want to talk about the latest hot new movies in theaters right this minute. This is a place for people who can't get to the theater until the third week a film is out; a place for people who just want to find something great to stream online after the kids have gone to sleep, a place for people whose favorite pastime is to grab a bunch of classic films on DVD from the library and watch them all weekend. It's a place that believes that every great movie is a wonderful new treasure, whether you see it the night of its premiere or fifty years later. It's a site about discovering good movies... one bad movie at a time.\n\nJoin us for our weekly review of movies worth seeing, worth avoiding and our Top 5 lists – and don’t forget to play along at www.alternateending.com.",

Well, we won’t just be talking about one thing in particular. The main thrust of it is to have a conversation and follow it where ever it takes us. One episode might focus on a movie while another might focus on an entire TV show run. Add to that some episodes with guests and interviews and you get a variety of content all contained within one Podcast, but always focusing on entertainment media.\nWe’re getting together to talk. We’ll gripe, we’ll have heated debates, we’ll commiserate, but most of all, we’ll have fun doing it.\nSome episodes will be in English and others in Spanish (with some Spanglish seeping through). But, we’re part of the Latino community here in the United States and we’re sure that, Spanish or English, you’ll enjoy our content all the same.",

We don’t want you to come here to find essays that put the writer’s ego before the importance of the film. \n\nBasically, we don’t want you to come here to be bored.\n\nHere at Grumpire, we think positively about the value of criticism. We’re not here to feel important, or to score points, but to really, genuinely appreciate culture for what it is. And sometimes, that means being a grump. But hey, cynicism comes naturally to our generation.\n\nWe know there is an audience of filmgoers out there who have discerning tastes, and brothers and sisters, we are here for you. We want to help our audience reconsider the affect filmmaking has on them, and go beyond the conventional “good” and “bad.” Let’s get smart, let’s get engaged, let’s get weird.\n\nPlease, join us on our journey to truly enjoy culture again.",
