        "description": "Bulletproof Executive Radio was born out of a fifteen-year single-minded crusade to upgrade the human being using every available technology. It distills the knowledge of world-class MDs, biochemists, Olympic nutritionists, meditation experts, and more than $1M spent on personal self-experiments. From private brain EEG facilities hidden in a Canadian forest to remote monasteries in Tibet, from Silicon Valley to the Andes, high tech entrepreneur Dave Asprey used hacking techniques and tried everything himself, obsessively focused on discovering: What are the simplest things you can do to be better at everything? Welcome to being Bulletproof, the State of High Performance where you take control and improve your biochemistry, your body, and your mind so they work in unison, helping you execute at levels far beyond what you’d expect, without burning out, getting sick, or just acting like a stressed-out a-hole. It used to take a lifetime to radically rewire the human body and mind this way. Technology has changed the rules. Follow along as Dave Asprey and guests provide you with everything you need to upgrade your mind, body, and life.",

Expect two exciting types of shows. One: a light-hearted conversation with a pro who takes the HELL out of HEALTHY (be it with a smoothie, acupuncture needles, or a non-judgy style of yoga). Two: me venting or answering your questions (which you can submit on partyinmyplants.com/answermyq)! With episodes about plant-based eating, easy healthy cooking, fitness, digestion, meditation, weight loss, healthy travel, sneaking snacks into movies, beating anxiety and cohabiting with non-healthy people...you can expect to feel chill and confident with a new, easy hack for healthier living each time your headphones stream this show.",

Join your host Kelli Walker – registered nurse, Certified Health and Wellness Coach, and former agoraphobe – on an anxiety adventure. Learn what anxiety really is, why the best of us can get caught in its web, and how to move past its sticky grip. Casual conversations with Kelli and other experts will include more than reciting daily affirmations or following \"five simple steps\" to overcome anxiety. Instead, you'll get practical tips, resources, and guidance while gaining a down-to-earth and deeper understanding of what it means to be human – an easily overlooked part of truly moving past anxiety. No experience in deep breathing, chakra alignment, or pescetarianism required. Listen in for a good laugh and start feeling a little more human today.

For example, we now know that meditation not only lowers stress and improves mental sharpness but it also strengthens our immune system, gives us more youthful and healthy brain tissue, and can be as good or better than prescription drugs for treating mental illnesses like depression, addiction, and PTSD. So maybe there is something to what all those ancient masters were talking about. Turns out when you strip away the religious and institutional covers, they figured out how to feel happy, healthy and fulfilled and told us how to do it. This podcast provides an easy way to access the simple meditation and mindfulness practices developed by the wisest masters to have graced this planet. Zebediah Rice guides you in an easy and free way to learn to meditate, become more mindful, energetic, happy, peaceful, and mentally sharp. Just sit back, relax, and let me do the work for you.",

The benefits and dangers of different types of rehab from those that have experienced it.\n\nThe \"point of no return' is when the individual has come to a realization that they need and want help. \n\nThis is also for friends and family of addicts who are at their wits end and don't know what to do to help the addict.  This podcast gives hope and inspiration for recovery.\n\nSome topics include:\n- Where can I get help?\n- How do I know if my child or relative or friend is addicted?\n- How do I get someone up to realizing they need help?",

I’m Tracy Otsuka your host and I’m committed to changing the conversation around ADHD. When I was diagnosed eight months after my son, my entire life suddenly made perfect sense but all I heard about was everything that my ADHD brain SHOULD be struggling with when in fact I would come to learn that my ADHD is responsible for some of my greatest superpowers. \n\nOne other thing, we constantly hear about all the successful ADHD men, but no one talks about the women. This podcast is here to change that dynamic. ADHD women are my people, and I’m here to acknowledge, support and cheer them on.",

        "description": "Oriental medicine was not developed in a laboratory. It does not advance through double-blind controlled studies, nor does it respond well to petri dish experimentation. Our medicine did not come from the statistical regression of randomized cohorts, but from the observation and treatment of individuals in their particular environment. It grows out of an embodied sense of understanding how life moves, unfolds, develops and declines.\n\n\nMedicine comes from continuous, thoughtful practice of what we do in clinic, and how we approach that work. The practice of medicine is more — much more — than simply treating illness. It is more than acquiring skills and techniques. And it is more than memorizing the experiences of others. It takes a certain kind of eye, an inquiring mind and relentlessly inquisitive heart.\n\nQiological is an opportunity to deepen our practice with conversations that go deep into acupuncture, herbal medicine, cultivation practices, and the practice of having a practice. It’s an opportunity to sit in the company of others with similar interests, but perhaps very different minds. Through these dialogues perhaps we can better understand our craft.",

It is a holistic approach to healing the body and mind naturally, maintaining balance and preventing dis-ease. Ayurveda is a vast science, giving us guidelines on every aspect of our life, it's the manual to life that most of us never received!\nColette, the host, will share the teachings of Ayurveda, along with her passion for health and wellness, nutrition, yoga, fitness, meditation, pranayama and much more. Always curious and ready to learn, she will be interviewing inspirational people along the way. Colette’s humble wish is to help people connect to their ‘true nature’, to Mother Nature and to each other.",

        "description": "In this unfiltered podcast about infertility, Brooklyn-based journalist and mom-of-two Ali Prato, who went through IVF herself, talks to women—and some men—about the messy, frustrating, painful, heartbreaking, absurd and sometimes hilarious journey to have a baby. Or in some cases, to not have a baby. Each episode tells a different story, getting real about miscarriages, egg freezing, sperm donors, adoption, infertility depression, secondary infertility, surrogacy, endometriosis, IUIs, acupuncture, nutrition, relationship drama, embryonic genetic testing, money issues, that crazy jealousy you feel when you see someone else with a baby bump, and so much more. We’ll cover the happy endings, the soul-crushingly sad ones, and the ones still in limbo.",
