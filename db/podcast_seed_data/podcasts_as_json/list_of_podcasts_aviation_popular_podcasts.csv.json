AviatorCast bridges the gap between actual flight training and flight simulation to give prospective aviators, current pilots, and even the seasoned flyer new perspectives in aviation. \n\n\n\nThrough studying Human Factors we learn to combat the worst enemy to our flying success; ourselves. How can we become better aviators by interacting with our airplanes more effectively? How can we overcome the shortcomings of our human condition to make better decisions on the flight deck? \n\n\n\nWe believe in learning to a confidence level, not learning to a level required by law. When you get a license, you should be ready to go out and fly in those conditions, with those aircraft, and do so with refined skills. \n\n\n\nFlight simulators these days are very advanced, and we will discuss how you can sure up your flight training with a home based simulator, giving you limitless hours and practice in IFR with scenario based training. \n\n\n\nLearn how to fly, become better at your flying craft, mold into a safer pilot, or perfect your professional skills. \n\n\n\nAviatorCast is an engaging and entertaining podcast that is sure to deliver on the topics you care about.",

        "description": "A New York native turned southern gentleman! Derek found a niche for public speaking and aviation early on during his years of high school and ultimately realized that he wanted to give back to the community. He comes from a family of those that have served, as his step father was a Huey and Chinook pilot in the U.S. Army, and currently flies a Sikorsky S-76D. His mother was a flight attendant for TWA and currently works as a CSR at FlightSafety Intl. Derek is currently an air traffic controller at Atlanta TRACON in Peachtree City, Georgia. While being an advocate for personal growth, he is also a proponent of social justice and ensuring that people use their voice on any platform they desire. Derek believes facilitating meaningful and constructive dialogue surrounding emotional and complex topics is the first step toward plausible and sensible solutions. It goes without saying, Derek’s passion for aviation is undeniable! Although Personal Development is something he is fully committed to because of the impact it has on our everyday lives, his  goal is to help others understand their worth with the talents they currently possess and to solidify core values such as morals and ethics. Pro-social intervention is the answer! In Derek’s spare time he enjoys flying with friends, traveling to new destinations and trying new craft beers!",

Fitz, Lee, and Terry seem to get their hands into just about every corner of this hobby. We like it all! The truth is, we share a lot of common interests, but we each have our own specific favorites and specialties. That's probably why we have so much fun when we get together. We use the recording sessions to catch up with each other, get things off our chests, and throw around a few light-hearted insults. We start each episode with a short list of topics we plan to cover, but you never know where the conversation will go.",
