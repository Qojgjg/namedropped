Through the honesty, humility and humor of his own personal experiences, he points to the possibility of navigating life’s trials with a true inner yearning for truth. His own practice of kirtan or chant is the well stone of his ability to share from his spiritual heart. As KD says, “Love is a disease - we catch it from those who have it.”",

        "description": "The Song Celestial unfolds a dialogue of the advice given by an avatar or God incarnate. The recipient of the message is Arjuna, the prototype of the struggling human soul who is ready to receive the great knowledge by his close companionship and increasing nearness to the divine Self within himself. \nThis symbolic companionship of Krishna and Arjuna, the divine and the human soul is further dramatized by the fact that their dialogue takes place amidst the din and clamor of a battlefield. The teacher in the Gita is therefore not only the God who is transcendent but also the God in man who unveils Himself through an increasing knowledge... \n                                                                     Vanamali, Nitya Yoga.  \nAldous Huxley, asserts that ‘The Bhagavad Gita occupies an intermediate position between scripture and theology; for it combines the poetical qualities of the first with the clear-cut methodicalness of the second. ‘The book may be described’ writes Ananda K. Coomaraswamy in his admirable Hinduism and Buddhism, ‘as a compendium of the whole doctrine to be found in the earlier Vedas, Brahmanas and Upanishads, and being therefore the basis of all the The later developments, it can be regarded as the focus of all Indian religion...\n...But this focus of Indian religion is also one of the clearest and most comprehensive summaries of the perennial philosophy ever to have been made. Hence its enduring value, not only for Indians, but for all mankind’.\nThe Bhagavad Gita (Song Celestial) offers an understanding of The Great Mystery, which has inspired many of the giants of the Western intellectual tradition. The transcendentalist poets Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman were students of The Bhagavad Gita. Thoreau wrote: ‘In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous cosmological philosophy of The Bhagavad Gita, in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial.’\nEmerson, referring to the Gita, wrote: ‘It was the first of books. It was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which in another age . . . had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which exercise us.’\nThis is a series of discourses on the liberating teachings of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Song Celestial) by Mataji (Mother) Vanamali, Vanamali Gita Yogasram, Rishikesh, North India.\nVanamali Mataji is the author of The Lila Hindu World Heritage Library. Her books include: a translation of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Nitya Yoga, a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita,  Sri Krishna Lila, Sri Rama Lila, Sri Shiva Lila, Sri Devi Lila, Sri Hanuman Lila, Lilas of the Sons of Shiva, Gurudeva  and The Taste Divine. Sri Devi Lila is published in the U.S. as  Shakti: Realm of The Divine Mother , Sri Hanuman Lila  as  Hanuman: The Devotion and Power of The Monkey God.\nEach talk is introduced with the Sanskrit invocations and chanting of the Gita chapter. Then Mataji Vanamali offers a line-by-line illumination of Shri Krishna's liberating teachings.\nWe invite you to visit our website: www.Vanamaliashram.org\nand enjoy our Pilgrims Guide, Discourses and Book & Music store.",

The episode of Lord Krishna imparting knowledge to Arjuna occurs in the epic Mahabharata.  There are totally 700 verses classified into 18 chapters.  Krishna gives the essence of the entire Veda in his teaching.  He explains in detail various disciplines like Karma Yoga, Devotion, Values, Meditation, and so on.  Lord Krishna also imparts knowledge about the true nature of God, World and Beings and clearly points out the underlying oneness of God and Beings.\n            \n            In these 322 classes, all the 700 verses of the Bhagavad Gita are explained word by word, in keeping with Shankaracharya's commentary. These classes will help the listener in gaining a thorough knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita.\n            \n            The summary of Bhagavad Gita - Chapter1, given by Swami Paramarthananda, is available for download.  This chapter is called Arjunavisada Yoga, since it deals primarily with Arjuna's grief.\n            \n            The entire collection of Swamiji's talks is available at the Poornalayam website.",

This is a very important month spiritually.The first 7 days are normally given to reading the Ramayana.  Vanamali Ashram is grateful to carry on this ancient tradition and offer this reading of Sri Rama Lila, Vanamali’s translation of this timeless legend.--\nThis is the story of the Lord’s descent on earth as Rama, the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu, scion of the race of Raghu, pinnacle of human perfection.--\nAnyone who reads this wonderful book cannot help but be moved to tears. It will make him or her ecstatic. The beauty of this book is that it is  written by one who has great love and devotion for Sri Rama. It touches some subtle chords in the readers heart...

        "description": "The Wisdom Inspired Life podcast shares with listeners the most proven and practical wisdom writings and talks.  The purpose is to help listeners quickly gain access to a broad range of proven wisdom teachings as they search for teachings that are uniquely helpful to them on their spiritual journey. \nTeachings are from channeled books like Sanaya Roman’s Living With Joy to contemporary wisdom teachers like the Tibetan Master Sogyal Rinpoche to centuries old wisdom teaching from Pantanjali to great enlightened avatars like Paramahansa Yogananda……and 25 more wisdom teachers. \nMost of the podcasts use direct quotes from the great wisdom teachers so listeners can directly connect with the words and wisdom of the teachings.\nThe inspiration for this podcast comes from my wisdom inspired life.  At times, I found the search slow and even frustrating.  I wished I could gain quicker access to the really great and proven teachings.  I share my experiences in my book, My Wisdom Inspired Life, A Provocative True Story—available on Amazon in paperback and as a Kindle book",
