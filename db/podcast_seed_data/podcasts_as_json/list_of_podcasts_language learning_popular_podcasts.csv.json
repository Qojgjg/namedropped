Complete the assigned lesson on the website and memorize new vocabulary on the flashcards before coming in for one-on-one studies.\n\n2. You can talk about anything, as long as you employ grammar introduced in the lesson.\n\n3. Don't be afraid to switch to English if you don’t know how to say something in French - but switch back to French as soon as you can!\n\n\n\nFollow our heroes from Act 1, with conversation mostly in English, to Act 30, where they speak mostly French!\n\n\nTogether with Valerie's colorful students, you will learn the fundamentals of French grammar and expressions. Your vocabulary will expand rapidly and naturally, and your comprehension skills will improve dramatically.\n\n\nEnjoy the characters, their secrets, desires, and motivations to learn French!

But when you speak, you stumble, hesitate, have to stop to think and \"write it\" in your head... It's very frustrating. These French Verb Drills are designed to help you memorize the verb forms, and the way they are pronounced in French today. The aim is not to explain the tenses, nor to help you figure out how to construct them, but to help you gain speed when it comes to saying that verb form. Make sure you first listen to the intro to make the best use of these verb drills. Transcripts, additionnal drills, and more audio material are available at FrenchToday.com (by the author of LearnFrenchInBoston.com)",

It covers a wide range of topics and proficiency levels(Novice, Intermediate, Advanced). Every story has two parts: story (A)  and story explanation (B), accompanied by annotated vocabulary and transcript.  For example, an episode titled \"2.3.12 A\" means this episode is at the level of Intermediate High (2.3), is the 12th episode created for this level, and is the story, not story explanation.

Couple Liz and Rob (Colombian and English) share anecdotes, Spanish vocabulary, phrases, and much more in a series of real conversations. Rob's not a native speaker, so you can hear Liz correct him occasionally, as well as hear her crystalline Colombian Spanish. We also interview other guests, providing a range of different accents from all over the Spanish speaking world. Learn slang from various regions of Spain, Colombia, Mexico, and more.

I’m a normal person, not some big company and not some native Spanish speaker. I’m not a natural language learner at all actually. My first brush with Spanish ended with me getting an F in high school!  But somewhere along the way, I fell in love! I’m not sure if I love Spanish because I love traveling, or I love traveling because I love Spanish (and food). But I love them both.  Naturally, I want more people to love what I love, but I know that you probably don’t see Spanish like I do… not yet! That’s the point of this podcast.  I want to show you that there is ANOTHER WAY! That most of the strategies and tactics they used to teach us Spanish in high school are IGNORANT.  They are ignorant to our plight.   I know your mistakes. I understand why you make them. They were my mistakes too!  I remember the pain and the agony of having to figure it all out myself because... let’s just say... I was underwhelmed with the resources out there.  Well, now with these videos (or audios) you don’t don’t have to waste the years I did.",

        "description": "A wandering king who's a war-hero doomed to roam the earth by a vengeful God, a plethora of fantastic experiences, a wife battling the invasion of suitors who wish to replace her missing husband, a son in search of his father - the Odyssey is a rich tapestry of incredible experiences and unforgettable characters. A must-read classic for anyone who wants to understand the fundamentals of Western mythology, it is a sequel to the Illiad which recounts the magnificent saga of the Trojan War. The Odyssey continues on, describing the trials and tribulations of the Greeks under the leadership of Odysseus. \n\nReputed to have been composed nearly three thousand years ago, its authorship is still being debated by scholars, though much of it is attributed to the blind poet Homer about whom very little is known. Yet the Illiad and The Odyssey remain the definitive foundations of all Western literature. The Odyssey is a magnificent epic tale that portrays the journey called life. In fact the word “odyssey” in English itself has come to mean a long and eventful journey. \n\nIn the preceding book The Illiad, Odysseus called Ulysses in Roman mythology, the king of Ithaca, gets embroiled in the Trojan War through the trickery of the Greeks. But once inside, his wonderful qualities of intellect, strategy and leadership come to the foreground as he leads his soldiers to victory. The story of the Odyssey begins when the war of The Illiad ends. Odysseus and his men embark to return to Ithaca but his sworn enemy, the sea god Poseidon, stymies him at every turn, sending storms and foul weather, forcing the wanderers to take shelter in strange and sinister lands. \n\nThe Odyssey is, besides, the story of Odysseus' beautiful wife Penelope, whose life becomes a struggle, fighting off the innumerable hopefuls who wish to take over her kingdom and her fortune in the absence of her husband. It is also the poignant growing-up tale of Telemachus, a faithful and steadfast son, who refuses to believe that his father won't return. \n\nThere are many notable translations from the original Greek and it has also been extensively portrayed in art, literature, television and television in languages around the world. Full of human tragedy, bizarre and fantastic creatures, gods and magical beasts, the Odyssey is a treasure-chest of marvelous events. For modern-day readers, young and old alike, it provides exciting, interesting and relevant ideas of war, politics, exile and identity.",

        "description": "A divinely beautiful woman who becomes the cause of a terrible war in which the gods themselves take sides. Valor and villainy, sacrifices and betrayals, triumphs and tragedies play their part in this three thousand year old saga.\n\nThe Iliad throws us right into the thick of battle. It opens when the Trojan War has already been raging for nine long years. An uneasy truce has been declared between the Trojans and the Greeks (Achaeans as they're called in The Iliad.) In the Greek camp, Agamemnon the King of Mycenae and Achilles the proud and valiant warrior of Phthia are locked in a fierce contest to claim the spoils of war. The gods in Olympus watch horrified as the best of Greeks and Trojans are slain. However, Zeus has prohibited them from openly interfering. But finally, even the gods cannot stay neutral. The mighty Zeus steps in to prod the Trojans into breaching the truce. Achilles, who is sulking in his tent refuses to fight and the Greeks suffer terrible losses.\n\nAchilles, a demigod is the son of the sea nymph Thetis and the King of the Myrmidions Peleus. He  has been rendered immortal like the gods except for one spot near his foot where his mother held him while she dipped him in the Styx. He is the greatest hero in The Iliad and known for his rage, impulsiveness and courage. \n\nHe watches as his comrades fall one by one and finally puts his pride aside. He sends his beloved friend Patroclus into battle. But Apollo, the savior of the Trojans, dashes away Patroclus' armor and the Trojan prince Hector slays him. Maddened by anger and grief, Achilles vows revenge and resumes battle. And the epic goes on...\n\nThe Iliad is purportedly written by the blind poet Homer some time during the eighth century BC. Its supreme importance in Greek literature slowly permeated to the rest of the Western world and in time to come, the two epic poems, The Iliad and The Odyssey became the reference points for thousands of works of art. European museums and art galleries are filled with works based on the themes, heroes and divinities from The Iliad. Contemporary films have portrayed the Trojan War, while tourists throng the sites mentioned in the poems. \n\nIt was first translated into English in the sixteenth century and has since then, gripped the collective imagination for generations. As one of the defining myths of western literature, The Iliad is indeed a must read for anyone interested in an epic tale.",
