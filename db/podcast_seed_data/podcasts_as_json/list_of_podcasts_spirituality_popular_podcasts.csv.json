On the other weekdays, Brandon and Dr. Erica Middlemiss take turns hosting solo episodes as they feature clips from various philosophers and teachers, take questions from listeners, features Mystic Manor retreat guests, and dig into a plethora of mind-expansive topics that will help to expand your perspective and keep your soul fed on a regular basis. Occasionally, Alexa Houser steps in on Friday's to highlight what magical things some of our listeners are up to in the world on the (p)HeAd Posse episodes. It's a daily conscious effort and it takes a tribe to help us all keep a Positive Head, which is why we’re here to help you keep your consciousness elevated five days a week!",

        "description": "The implication of the title - Buddha at the Gas Pump - is that ordinary people are experiencing higher states of consciousness once thought to be rare and difficult to attain.\n\nPeople everywhere are undergoing a shift or awakening to their true nature. For some, this shift has been abrupt and dramatic. For others, it has been so gradual that they may not have realized it has occurred. \n\n\n\nSuch shifts, or awakenings, are not new: Christ spoke of the Kingdom of Heaven within, Buddhists speak of Nirvana, Zen masters of Satori, Hindus of Moksha, but these traditions generally regard these states as rare and difficult to attain.\n\n\n\nMany people are therefore skeptical of claims of higher states of consciousness. They find it hard to believe that apparently ordinary friends and neighbors might be experiencing something extraordinary. Maybe they expect Enlightenment to look as remarkable on the outside as it is reputed to be on the inside.\n\n\n\nThis show will attempt to dispel skepticism and misconceptions by week after week, allowing otherwise ordinary people to relate their experience of spiritual awakening. The terminology is tricky, because there are no universally agreed upon definitions to describe this experience. So please forgive us if we use some unfamiliar terms. We will try to clarify our definitions as we go along.\n\n\n\nPerhaps, after a while, those listening will become convinced that genuine and permanent spiritual awakenings are not just a pipe dream, but are real and are becoming relatively commonplace.\n\n\n\nThese podcasts are the audio track of a weekly interview show which may be seen as videos on our YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/user/buddhaatthegaspump). Also see the main site: https://batgap.com. \n\n\n\nFor search purposes, I will add the following to this description - batgap, Buddha at the Gaspump, Buddah at the Gas Pump.",

Based on the Vedas, the sacred scriptures of India, Vedanta affirms the oneness of existence, the divinity of the soul, and the harmony of religions.\nAccording to Vedanta, God is infinite existence, infinite consciousness, and infinite bliss. The term for this impersonal, transcendent reality is Brahman, the divine ground of being. Yet Vedanta also maintains that God can be personal as well, assuming human form in every age.\nVedanta further asserts that the goal of human life is to realize and manifest our divinity. Not only is this possible, it is inevitable. Our real nature is divine; God-realization is our birthright.\nFinally, Vedanta affirms that all religions teach the same basic truths about God, the world, and our relationship to one another.",

Join author, Eric Rankin and Community Connector, Michelle Anderson as they delve into any number of topics: From spirituality to energy medicine to dolphin intelligence to ancient aliens, no subject is too far outside of the box to discuss.\n\nIn 2010, Eric’s bestselling novel “The Aquarians” became Amazon’s 2nd highest rated science fiction title, and he has been a guest on many TV and radio programs discussing humanity’s movement into the dawning Aquarian Age. For centuries, this “New Age” has been regarded as a time when the world will wake up to what mystics and shamans call the “Next Level” of consciousness.\n\nEric’s family began visiting Laguna in the early 1960s, and he actually lived in one of the Treasure Islands trailers where the Montage now stands. He vividly remembers having long talks with Eiler Larson, Laguna’s official greeter, and continues to enjoy strolling Laguna’s beautiful shoreline as often as possible.\n\nMichelle has been facilitating gatherings in Laguna for those seeking Spiritual Connection and Conscious Collaboration for over 10 years.\n\nShe creates experiences for people to connect with the dolphins and whales, leads groups of people on journeys to sacred places and holds space for people to connect with their true eternal essence.\n\nShe is an avid supporter of Indigenous communities and regularly supports events that bring people back to nature and peace with each other and the earth.  As a Sacred Activist, she is passionate about sharing information that brings humanity into greater awareness about important issues taking place locally and globally.",

        "description": "Fred McKinnon is a Georgia-based pianist and composer.  His music is ideal for devotional times of prayer, meditation, instrumental worship, soaking worship, studying music, sleeping music, and relaxation music.  It includes both solo piano and orchestrated music that is perfect for personal listening, soundtracks, and film scoring.\n\n\n\nHis desire is that the music he creates would inspire others in their faith or personal times of contemplation.  Some have characterized these piano instrumentals as healing music, background music, prophetic music, study music, meditation music, calming music, soothing music, and relaxing music.   \n\n\n\nIn religious settings, Fred's music has been played as background music for soaking worship, altar calls, prelude music, and music for personal and corporate prayer and devotions.\n\n\n\nFred McKinnon's instrumental music is also frequently used in schools and classrooms because of the calming affect it has on children and is used to help people rest and sleep better, such as those with insomnia or sleep disorders.  \n\n\n\nAnother frequent use of this music is in the world of fitness and physical care, such as yoga, massage therapy, and stretch or de-stress classes.\n\n\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite:  http://www.fredmckinnon.com\n\nFacebook:  http://www.facebook.com/FredMcKinnonMusic\n\nYouTube:  http://www.youtube.com/FredMcKinnonMusic",

        "description": "You know those deep conversations you have late at night, when your guard is down and everyone is just letting the truth spill out? That is what I am hoping to cultivate every day here. This experience we call life is a winding, bumpy and sometimes challenging road, especially if you are on the path of becoming more conscious, wakeful, contemplative and purposeful. I want to talk about it, I want to share stories and insights that inspire us all to keep rising up into a powerful, purposeful, soulful life. The intention of this podcast is to offer support, to be a voice in the chaos, a reminder that you are a spiritual being having a human experience and that you are NOT alone. Let's get down and dirty and talk about real life, what it means to awaken, the ugly truth of the challenges we face and how we navigate them. Let's unravel the conditioning, limiting beliefs and b******t that keeps us from creating our most meaningful and wakeful life. Let's delve in deep with others as the walk us through their path, their trials and tribulations and follow the breadcrumbs that led them to creating a meaningful, soulful life. There is so much power in stories, truth-telling and thoughtful conversations and this is the space for them. It is time to wake up to your divine nature, your dharma, your purpose and your light.",

        "description": "Swami Tattwamayananda’s exposition of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras was given at the Vedanta Society of Northern California, San Francisco (founded by Swami Vivekananda in 1900) from October 10, 2014 to December 21, 2018 in a series of 111 lectures. These lectures include a mixture of philosophy both Eastern and Western, history, psychology, comparative theology, mysticism, classical parables, and simple everyday examples.  \n\nPatanjali was a great Indian sage who wrote major treatises on Ayurveda, Sanskrit grammar and Yoga.  The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali contain 195 sutras organized into four chapters.  It gives a complete analysis of the mental system, how to transcend mental conflicts by linking the mind to a transcendental spiritual reality and how to become established in our true nature.    \n\nThe classes are given from the viewpoint of Vedanta, one of the oldest philosophies of the world, which constitute the universal spiritual essence of the Vedas, the foundational scriptures of Hinduism.  During the exposition, the Swami has drawn extensively from authentic Sanskrit commentaries and interpretative works like ‘Yoga-Bhasya’ of Vyasa, ‘Tattwa-Vaisharadi” of Vachaspati Mishra, ‘Yoga-Varttika’ of Vijnana Bhikshu, ‘Raja-Martanda’ of Bhoja Raja, ‘Yoga-Sudhakara’ of Sadashivendra Saraswati, with occasional references from ‘Yoga-Maniprabha’ of Ramananda Yati, ‘Patanjala-Yogashastra-Vivarana’ of Sri Shankara, and interpretations of Yoga-aphorisms by Swami Vivekananda and Swami Hariharananda Aranya.\n\n“By the Vedas no books are meant.  They mean the accumulated treasury of spiritual laws discovered by different persons in different times.” “The moral, ethical, and spiritual relations between soul and soul and between individual spirits and the Father of all spirits, were there before their discovery, and would remain even if we forgot them.\" (Paper on Hinduism, Swami Vivekananda, World's Parliament of Religions 1893)\n\nAccording to this series of classes, the Yoga system of Patanjali reaches its ultimate fulfillment in the conclusions of Vedanta, that there is one all-pervading, immanent, eternal spiritual reality, which is our own true nature.  \n\nIn the original text of Patanjali the order is 1. Samadhipada 2. Sadhanapada 3. Vibhutipada 4. Kaivalyapada.  But in this exposition of the Yoga-sutra the speaker has followed a different order, which seems to be more logical from the standpoint of actual Yoga-sadhana, i.e., 1. Sadhanapada 2. Vibhutipada 3. Samadhipada 4. Kaivalyapada.  To help beginners in the study of Yoga philosophy, the basic definitions from the first few aphorisms of Samadhipada are explained at the beginning.\n\nFor more:\nWeb: www.sfvedanta.org\nLivestream: https://livestream.com/sfvedanta\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/sfvedanta\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/SFVedanta\n\nAll Original Content © Vedanta Society of Northern California",

        "description": "Swami Tattwamayananda, currently the Minister of the Vedanta Society of Northern California, San Francisco, (originally founded by Swami Vivekananda in 1900) served in various centers of the Ramakrishna Order in India as editor, publisher, and teacher of Sanskrit, Advaitic texts such as Sri Shankaracharya's commentaries on the 'Prasthanatraya' (the fundamental Sanskrit texts of Vedanta philosophy), Buddhism and Indian philosophy.  He underwent traditional training in Hindu scriptures, Sanskrit, Vedic and Vedantic literature for many years, from his early days.  Before coming to the United States in January 2012 he was teaching Sanskrit, Vedantic scriptures and Indian philosophy at the Training center in Belur Math, the institution that trains the monks of the Ramakrishna Order at the headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission, Kolkata, India. Apart from his traditional education, the Swami has also received modern University education in English literature, psychology, European history, and Western philosophy.  He is frequently invited for lectures on Yoga, Vedanta, and traditional Hindu scriptures and for participating in interfaith dialogues.\n\nFor more:\nWeb: www.sfvedanta.org\nLivestream: https://livestream.com/sfvedanta\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/sfvedanta\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/SFVedanta\nAll Original Content © Vedanta Society of Northern California",
