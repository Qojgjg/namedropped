It is still basically just me talking about stuff and things with my two nerdy friends Jonah Ray and Matt Mira when they’re available, and usually someone more famous and smarter than all of us. Swearing is still fun, so we still do that occasionally. I hope you like this new iteration which is the same as before, but if a name hangs you up unhealthily I’m sure you will not hesitate to unfurl your rage not only in the ‘reviews’ section but also now on all the various social media platforms that have popped up since we started in 2010, effectively murdering blogs.",

I like to say “I’m nuanced.” And I know I am not alone. So let’s take back the night!  This is the comedy podcast that every week is going to introduce another weird, hilarious, unique “grown up” celebrity guest to prove that even though you are technically an “adult”, you don’t have to be a total loser.

I’m Justin Long and I’ve been an actor for most of my life, so I’m used to getting inside the heads of the characters I play. But now that I’m getting older (I’m 41 now, yikes), I want to peek inside the heads of real people to learn how they find meaning in life. I’m also very curious what their favorite snack food is, and what emoji they use most often — ya know, the REALLY important stuff. Every episode I’ll get personal with all kinds of people, from actors to musicians to deep thinkers who fascinate me. My brother Christian is on hand each episode to keep me honest, and occasionally remind me about some of the embarrassing things I’ve done over the years. Join us, or if you have more important things to do, that’s okay too — life is short!",

The Brian Moote Show is funny first, but always has an opinion. \n\nBrian Moote is a recovering A-hole with a huge heart. He's a comedian and radio personality. Brian is kind of guy you want to hate, but then realize he has a Masters Degree in social work, and used to teach children with special needs. Then you start to fear him as your mind actually considers his logical, yet sometimes bold, opinions on the world's events. \n\nIf you enjoy some laughter, need a little news, and like to argue with your speakers, this show is yours to listen to. Research shows it makes you 4 times less likely to allow your significant other's inadequacies get to you.\n\nIf you like the show, please subscribe for free. You could also leave a rating and review on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, or wherever you listen to podcasts. Find Brian on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. \n\nNo research was done on this. ",

Join Brad Laackman and Steve Steketee as they throw their once private rants, raves, and reviews into the public’s face-with the help of some local celebrities. We’ll teach no lessons and solve no problems. It’s just 20-30 minutes of absolute B.S.Absolute B.S. with Brad and Steve is the brainchild of Brad Laackman and Steve Steketee. Highly experimental in tone and content, the pair decided they wanted to produce something different from the myriad of podcasts existing. Rather than approach the conversation in a typical fashion, their tactics are a bit more abrasive and humorous; generating honest and spontaneous content from their guests. It is their hope to provide a deeper insight into what makes Grand Rapids grand, while revealing the heart, soul, and goofier side of the men and women who make it so.",

Don’t worry, though. It’s not real. This is actually a narrative podcast. There’s discussions about religion, psychedelics, and the paranormal, among other philosophical and weird topics, and every single conversation is punctuated with a dire threat looming in the background. In other words, this podcast flies off the rails at every turn. It’s goofy, it’s completely insane, and you might learn something in the midst of the chaos.",
