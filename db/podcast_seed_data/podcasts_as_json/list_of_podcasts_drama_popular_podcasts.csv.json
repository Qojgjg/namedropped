Puck, he confides this previously undisclosed tale to the only surviving relation of his former team, Alex Robbins, the son of Puck’s friend Anthony. Over the course of ten episodes, the show will not only relate past tales of heroics, horror, and humor, but also sets the stage for future characters.\n\nIn Goldrush, fans will truly get to know these well-beloved characters characters on a much more emotionally satisfying level. Their humor and unique group dynamic certainly remain intact, and modeled after old Spaghetti Westerns, the story takes directions the series has not yet explored.\n\nFilled with action, battles with the undead, love triangles, conflicting loyalties, and of course gold, WE’RE ALIVE: GOLDRUSH stands out as a truly unique Theater for the Mind experience for both new and old listeners.",

But she’s not alone underground, and her dark night of the soul is interrupted by an extremist faction of similarly self-exiled tunnel-dwellers whose space she's invaded. Facing re-incarceration back above ground, but pushed to the limits of shame, paranoia, lust, hunger, and depraved entrepreneurialism below it, Dolores is the outcast of the outcasts again - until she takes her survival in the tunnels into her own Magic Hands. Season 2 of The Horror of Dolores Roach is written and directed by Aaron Mark and stars Daphne Rubin-Vega, Donnell Rawlings, and Amy Ryan.",

The original music serves each episode’s atmosphere in a way that embraces and enhances each scene.  So uncover the dark secrets, evil murders, supernatural experiences, and mysterious doctors awaiting in this modern epic.",

        "description": "The Diarist is a psychological drama exploring the alluring side of power and sexual attraction. Andrea Davies hopefully enters the paradoxical world of 1950s womanhood but she soon veers into an increasingly menacing extramarital affair with Richard Hayes, a dominant ad executive. However, the Diarist is no 50 shades of gray, more like a Hitchcock Love Story with a dose of David Lynch. The story starts innocently enough but soon turns bizarre as the inner worlds of the characters are revealed. The Diarist immerses listeners into the 1950s world of Madison Avenue advertising. Secrets are exposed, darkness descends, and for Andrea all roads appear to lead to a harrowing fate.\n\nCreated by: Donna Barrow-Green, Co-Produced by Donna Barrow-Green, Beth Ricketson, Ryan Bowen . Starring: Beth Ricketson, Ryan Bowen, Corrine Elena, Darlene Sorenson, Eric Schniewind, Nikki Flynn, Heather Dowling, Pierson Rintz, Shelly Bryant, Emerson McRaven\nSound Engineering by Donna Barrow-Green & Ben Green. Creative consulting: Chad Thumann.\n\n \n\n ",

Each season is standalone, so you can jump right into the podcast without having missed anything.\n\nIn this fourth season, our narrator Luke trades an aimless existence in New York for a secret double life in Berlin, where he is quickly pulled into the queer, expat, and nightlife communities. The people he meets, the music he hears, and the mischief he pursues all play a role in his antiheroic odyssey. He recounts the story for you here, producing and curating lots of great music along the way.\n\nThe Prospectives is a fictional podcast written and performed by Adam Hurly (@adamhurly), and all original music is produced by Joy Joseph (@joyjosephmusic). The series is edited by Jason Oberholtzer of Charts and Leisure. (www.chartsandleisure.com) \n\nFollow us on Instagram @TheProspectives for each episode's artwork, drawn by Paul Tuller (@paul.tuller and @vectorescapade), and to leave feedback or chat with other listeners.\n\nYou can also download PDFs of the first three series at www.theprospectives.com. Each season features a different illustrator and follows a unique LGBTQ narrative.",
