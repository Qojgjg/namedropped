Sometimes they are funny, sometimes they are scary, usually a bit of both. But they are always kid-safe, entertaining, yet calm enough to fall asleep to. Most importantly, we get right into the story without a bunch of self-promoting meta talk. Production is kept minimal with intention: we try to preserve the craft of storytelling by presenting the story exactly as we would when telling our own children, using only our voices.\n\nRead more at http://thecricketpodcast.com",

Of course, Cricket’s answers are always a mixture of fact and fiction, but through this embroidered truth, the characters in Mister Cricket’s Fire-Fables gain wisdom, make better choices, treat others as they should be treated, and, in general, lead more fulfilling lives. If you’re looking for family entertainment wrapped in sound advice, Mister Cricket’s Fire-Fables are something you and your children can warm up to.",
