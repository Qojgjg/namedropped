Поможет нам в этом Владимир Натанович Шацев – учитель литературы и кандидат филологических наук. Почти сорок лет в школах и вузах Санкт-Петербурга он учит детей читать. Читать медленно. И осмысленно. Читать, чувствовать и понимать художественный текст.  И вот сейчас, объединившись  с композитором, звукорежиссёром и молодыми актёрами, в этом подкасте он поделится тем, что умеет и любит делать.",

In this podcast, she will interview other lifeschoolers, as well as popular homeschool leaders to discuss the idea of lifeschooling and what it looks like in various family situations. Some of her favorite guests are the \"homeschool pioneers\" who educated their children quite differently than according to the traditional model...wisdom that has been largely forgotten in today's homeschool culture.\n\n\n\nDanielle has been homeschooling, or “lifeschooling,” for 14 years and started the biennial Lifeschooling Conference in 2016. She has a passion for helping other homeschoolers learn how to homeschool in a way that does not compete with family life, but actually enhances it and draws out each child's unique gifts.",

We hope to spark discussion of topics in education as we try to separate the practical from the wishful thinking and apply good practice to our very traditional learning community.  We invite you around our lunch table as we discuss among ourselves and invite others to join us periodically.
