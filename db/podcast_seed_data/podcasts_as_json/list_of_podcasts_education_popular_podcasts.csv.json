        "description": "Life at work can be funny, challenging, ridiculous, and -- yes, even satisfying. Here at Safe For Work, we're all about helping you find balance and happiness in your career. After all, many of us spend more time with our co-workers and clients than with our friends and family. Hosts Liz Dolan and Rico Gagliano give advice on everything from how to avoid burnout on the job to how to fake an illness when you're calling in sick. We also talk to experts about those moments at the office that can challenge the best of us: negotiating raises, knowing when it’s time to move on...or dealing with that annoying office mate with no boundaries. From Wondery, the network behind Business Wars, Safe For Work is helpful career advice that's lively and fun, just like your work life should be. In every episode, Liz and Rico talks with callers, business leaders and noted know-it-alls who share their hard-earned wisdom from the trenches. Liz Dolan is the former head of marketing at Nike, The Oprah Winfrey Network and National Geographic and host of the podcast Satellite Sisters. Rico Gagliano is a contributor to The Wall Street Journal, former host of podcast Dinner Party Download, reporter on the public radio show Marketplace, and co-author of BRUNCH IS HELL.",

Valerie, our French tutor, gives one-on-one lessons to beginner students. Valerie has three rules for her students:\n\n\n\n1. Complete the assigned lesson on the website and memorize new vocabulary on the flashcards before coming in for one-on-one studies.\n\n2. You can talk about anything, as long as you employ grammar introduced in the lesson.\n\n3. Don't be afraid to switch to English if you don’t know how to say something in French - but switch back to French as soon as you can!\n\n\n\nFollow our heroes from Act 1, with conversation mostly in English, to Act 30, where they speak mostly French!\n\n\nTogether with Valerie's colorful students, you will learn the fundamentals of French grammar and expressions. Your vocabulary will expand rapidly and naturally, and your comprehension skills will improve dramatically.\n\n\nEnjoy the characters, their secrets, desires, and motivations to learn French! Follow the 3 Valerie’s rules and learn with our students, Michelle, Jack, and Kevin! Bon voyage!",

In fact we talk about a lot of things that tree huggers would love: appreciation of beauty, gratitude, positive emotions, relationships and well, love. However we, that is positive psychologists and positive psychology practitioners buried ourselves in books, set out to experiment and then write it all up in a writing style that is about as exciting to read as watching an avocado turn brown. And that's the problem: if you are not an academic you probably want a little bit more excitement, than pages and pages of densely written journals can provide. Even if you are an academic, who has time to read all the interesting stuff out there anyways? So in an effort to save your eyes taking on a comically rectangular shape the positive psychology podcast brings the science of the good life to your earbuds. It's not all treehugger style though; sometimes we might get quite serious, for example when exploring things like post-traumatic growth or positive parenting. Subscribe if you want to benefit from the scientific insights into happiness and meaning while you are on the go. Let me know where you are while you are listening to this. If you like it review it, because that's the only way other people can find it too.",

How do you create a spirituality that’s more rock n’ roll than oppressive, turn your anxiety into power, and live more deeply but lighten up? Danielle keeps it practical while riffing on the divine—from compassion and self-help fatigue, to sex, joy, and serving the world. She is, as Eve Ensler describes, “a force field of energy, wonder, humor, and love”, and her authenticity will have you feeling a little less crazy, full of possibility, and clearly part of the solution.",

        "description": "In the past year, my life has flipped a complete 180º. I shared A LOT on my YouTube channel as I learned and changed, but I want to share more about: HOW I started trusting myself and increasing my confidence, how I began my recovery from codependency, how I deal with the struggles of loving a spouse in recovery from addiction, and how I lost 35lbs in 5 months! I don’t want anybody else stuck where I was. If I can help one person by telling my story, then it’s worth it. We all deserve to live a fulfilled life, and we all CAN! Y’all stay tuned, because I’ve got some things to share. ❤️ Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/katieontheflipside/support",
