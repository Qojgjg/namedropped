By better understanding chocolate, we can better appreciate it, more easily identify what we love, and support the makers and producers that create those kinds of bars.\nThe Slow Melt is hosted and written by journalist and author Simran Sethi. Guests include farmers, conservationists, manufacturers, tasting experts, scientists, social justice advocates, chocolate purveyors and, of course, award-winning chocolate makers.\nLearn more at theslowmelt.com",

        "description": "The purpose of this podcast is to share the stories and food recipes of the people who uncover our shared past-the field archaeologist. The field archaeologists is a unique individual. Their work is to excavate, recover, and survey our human past. In some sense they are modern-day nomads following the seasonal cycle of available work across the globe. Like all nomads they have few personal possessions and only live at one location for a short period of time. This non-traditional life is challenging in terms of having a “normal life” but with it comes unique experiences that few people get to enjoy. For the field archaeologist one of the most important experiences of their day is the shared evening meal.\n\nThe evening meal is probably the most important part of the day. This is when everyone comes together and shares food. Like traditional family meals this is when the day is discussed, stories are shared, and food is enjoyed.\n\nFood is culture. It defines who we are and it is one of the cultural artifacts that brings people together. For the field archaeologist there are memories involved in the making and eating food that we the editors of this blog believe that are important to share with the world. What better way to learn and experience archaeology then from the women and men doing the hard work- the field archaeologist!",

There is so much that is satisfying with making your own bread (sourdough and yeasted), cookies, beer, wine, cheese and other things!I will give you the step by step process on things that I have made many times and also things that I will be trying out.  Together we will consider successes and failures (Yes, I have had a number...just wait to hear about a cheese that took a whole year) and areas we can improve.I am by no means a professional chef nor baker, but that is what makes this fun!
