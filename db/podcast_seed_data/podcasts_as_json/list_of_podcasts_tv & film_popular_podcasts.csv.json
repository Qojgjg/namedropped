That’s right, this podcast will cover six different series and 30 seasons of television by journeying into every one of the 726 episodes with a single mission: to explore, debate and discuss one of the largest science fiction phenomena of all time, Star Trek. \n\nStarting with The Original Series’ initial pilot and continuing chronologically until we reach the last episode of Star Trek: Enterprise, each week our hosts, Ken Ray and John Champion, will tackle a single episode, delving into the most historical and hysterical science fiction that Star Trek has to offer.  Along with a variety of guests and interviews, Mission Log will attempt to reach Star Trek’s ethical subtext, understand it’s complex metaphors and finally figure out what was the trouble with those tribbles.\n\nExplore strange new details.  Seek out new perspectives; deeper understandings. Boldly go where so many of us love to go, again and again.  Join us for Mission Log!",

It is a heavily-researched work of creative nonfiction: navigating through conflicting reports, mythology, and institutionalized spin, Karina tries to sort out what really happened behind the films, stars and scandals of the 20th century.",

        "description": "Hold onto your Chelsea buns! Kimberly and Katie, from A Date with Dateline, are branching out from their usual crime and punishment rough stuff to a more delicious type of rough puff. For this series we are delighting in the return of The Great British Bake Off, with sugar dusted recaps and discussion with just a pinch of snark. Not too much snark or you’ll have a snarky bottom. We're dishing on all the things you love about Bake Off— the properly British, mostly disguised (but sometimes not) innuendo, Noel’s perfect comic timing and choice of sweaters, and the always heart-stopping Hollywood handshake, usually following one or ten of his disapproving death stares. Join us in acting like we know what we’re talking about when it comes to flour choices (isn't semolina a country?), proving times for a proper loaf, and praising bakers along the way for their use of bold spices like our palettes might well be just as refined as the mighty Prue. What is a claggy frangipane genoise, you might ask, and am I in the emergency room or a patisserie if I am having one? Never fear, all the mysteries of pastry will be revealed in...no, no they won't. But, that's why we are on the couch and not in the Bake Off tent. If you love American professional amateur podcasters intently watching a group of amateur British bakers compete in a competition for the glory of national pride and a really heavy looking cake platter trophy with both really just earnestly doing their best then this is the home for you. Fire up the ovens, er... earbuds and on your mark, get set... It’s A DATE WITH THE BAKE!",
