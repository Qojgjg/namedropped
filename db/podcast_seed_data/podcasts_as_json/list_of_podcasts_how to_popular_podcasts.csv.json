It has quickly become the leading choice of software used to develop cutting-edge statistical algorithms, innovative visualizations, and data processing, among other key features.   R has seen tremendous growth in popularity and functionality over the last decade, largely due to the vibrant and devoted R community of users.   Whether you have experience with commercial statistical software such as SAS or SPSS and want to learn R, or getting into statistical computing for the first time, the R-Podcast will provide you with valuable information and advice that will help you to tap into the power of R.  Our intent is to start with the basic concepts that can be a struggle for those new to R and statistical computing.  We will give practical advice on how to take advantage of R’s capabilities to accomplish innovative and robust data analyses.  Along the way we will highlight the additional tools and packages that greatly enhance the experience of using R, and highlight resources that can help people become experts with R.  While this podcast is not meant to be a series of lectures on statistics,  we will use freely and publicly available data sets to illustrate both basic statistical analyses as well as state-of-the-art algorithms to show how powerful and robust R can be for analyzing today’s explosion of data. In addition to the audio podcast, we will also produce screencasts for hands-on demonstrations for those topics that are best explained via video.",

I'll teach you all I can to find ancestors and details you haven't before. I'll tell stories from my 4 decades of mistakes and triumphs, with a tablespoon of snark mixed in. I'll teach you cooperative and Reparational Genealogy, and how Anglo- or European-American researchers can work with African-American researchers to restore connections destroyed by centuries of enslavement. I'll interview researchers in genealogy and related fields in all phases of their growth. I'll even give recipes from ancestral meals in the Family Cookbook episodes.",

How can I get more downloads? What does it take to market a podcast?\" Then you're in the right place, my friend. Entrepreneurs dream of creating deeper connections with their audience, but they're totally overwhelmed with the thought of podcasting. On this podcast, I strip down the process and take all of the overwhelm away. With my 3-Step approach (Start, Launch, and Market), I deliver content to help you take action and create a podcast your audience craves. I've worked with online business owners wanting to have a better marketing strategy, just like you, to individuals not even sure what a podcast is. The motto around here is, \"We all have to start somewhere.\" Join us every Tuesday and Thursday for new episodes on how you can Start, Launch, and Market your own podcast.",

My goal is for my guests and me to help you to become a better Prospector. The “On The Gold” Podcast is about gold Prospecting and Mining. Of course, we’ll cover other topics that relate to prospecting, but we are dedicated to helping you find more gold. We will cover in detail the basics of understanding gold and its geology, the methods and the true art of prospecting and recovering gold. From lode veins to river concentrates, from pan to detector, excavator to the refiner, we will cover it all. I will be reviewing some of the newest prospecting gear, from un-boxing to final thoughts offering you some insight as to what you need in your gear-box to what is better left on the shelf. I’ll talk about equipment and my favorites from years gone by. Some of this gear will be old enough that it will be an introduction to new prospectors, while for some of us “Old Timers” it’ll be like revisiting an old friend. Most importantly, “On The Gold” is your opportunity to ask questions and get answers from myself and other industry leaders. I know that we can help you find more gold and I hope that you will subscribe to the One The Gold Podcast. And as always, I invite you to join me out here, on the gold.",
