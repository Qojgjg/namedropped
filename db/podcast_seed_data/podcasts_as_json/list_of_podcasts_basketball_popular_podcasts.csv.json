We started back in 2014 as a way to discuss our favorite league like we would whenever we hung out outside of work. Little did we know two ex-Pennsylvanians who moved to Florida would now be entering our 6th season. Two cities, and a couple of radio jobs later, here we are. We strive to give you the best in everything NBA both on and off the court on a weekly basis and keep it light and fun, the way basketball is supposed to be. Honestly, which league is more fun than the NBA right now? Our goal is to make you feel like you’re sitting on the couch, at the barbershop, or at a barstool with us. We cover the league year-round from opening night in October, all the way through the NBA Finals in June. If that’s not enough, we keep going in the summer for the NBA draft, NBA summer league & free agency. Segments include Who’s Ballin, Who’s Fallin, our NBA version of the stock market where we tell you what’s trending up, and what’s trending down each week. We’ve also got Hot Takes from Reddit, where we bring you the spiciest and most comical takes from NBA Reddit each week. You also will hear the best in NBA guests throughout the season and all summer long. Like we said earlier though, the show is all about fun, because if you’re not having fun, why do something right? You can listen to the podcast on all platforms including iTunes, Google Play, Stitcher, PlayerFM & Spotify, as well as watch the podcast on YouTube. Leave us a review on iTunes, and we’ll read it on the show, good or bad!",

While still NBA fans our loyalties are divided across the league. Not liking traditional fantasy basketball, we started our own league. Where we draft teams not players. \n\nEric (Bubbs), Derek (Dichiro), Trevor, John Finn, Bryon and myself, Josh Hoover each draft 5 teams. We draft 3 times a year: beginning of the year, middle of the year and top 4 draft for the playoffs.\n\nThe name of the podcast is Attack the Rack because people are loosing sight of the importance of scoring at the rim. So much focus on the 3 and the best players who take and make a lot of really tough shots, but at the end of the day the most valuable part of the 3 is it pulls out the defense to open up the lane so you can ATTACK THE RACK!",
