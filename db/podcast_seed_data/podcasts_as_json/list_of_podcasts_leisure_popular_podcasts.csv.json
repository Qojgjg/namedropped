        "description": "Become the pilot you've always wanted to be. AviatorCast bridges the gap between actual flight training and flight simulation to give prospective aviators, current pilots, and even the seasoned flyer new perspectives in aviation. \n\n\n\nThrough studying Human Factors we learn to combat the worst enemy to our flying success; ourselves. How can we become better aviators by interacting with our airplanes more effectively? How can we overcome the shortcomings of our human condition to make better decisions on the flight deck? \n\n\n\nWe believe in learning to a confidence level, not learning to a level required by law. When you get a license, you should be ready to go out and fly in those conditions, with those aircraft, and do so with refined skills. \n\n\n\nFlight simulators these days are very advanced, and we will discuss how you can sure up your flight training with a home based simulator, giving you limitless hours and practice in IFR with scenario based training. \n\n\n\nLearn how to fly, become better at your flying craft, mold into a safer pilot, or perfect your professional skills. \n\n\n\nAviatorCast is an engaging and entertaining podcast that is sure to deliver on the topics you care about.",

This is the podcast with easy-to-understand resources, tips, and information to help beginning gardeners get the most out of their gardening adventure -- big or small. When I began gardening in 2013, I scoured books and Internet resources to find all the information I could. Although good information was abundant, I had trouble understanding all the gardening lingo and sifting through the information to figure out what would work for me. In this podcast, my aim is to provide helpful information while explaining the gardening lingo as we go. I want to equip YOU to have the best start ever this gardening season!",

        "description": "When Elizabeth Ries and Margery Punnett hosted a myTalk 107.1 radio show together, they joked that their most personal conversations happened during the commercial breaks. During one of these pauses, Margery shared an important family principle: bringing your best self to your home. Being an urban farmer with a flock of chickens, Elizabeth quipped, \"Bring your best to the nest!\" The outside world shouldn't get the smiling happy version of you while your family gets the crabby and exhausted one. On \"Best To The Nest,\" Margery & Elizabeth explore the simple concept of creating strong, comforting, beautiful nests that prepare us to fly.",

I had a lot of very specific questions I wanted to ask game designers and publishers, and as it turns out, they're more than happy to answer those questions when asked. So, I created the BGDL Podcast. I release a weekly show that interviews designers, publishers, and board game insiders on specific topics. We don't waste time talking about games we've played lately or get caught up on pop culture. There are plenty of other podcasts that do those things very well. Instead, the show does a deep dive into subjects that I hope listeners find extremely valuable as they progress through their game design journeys. The show comes out on Wednesdays.",
