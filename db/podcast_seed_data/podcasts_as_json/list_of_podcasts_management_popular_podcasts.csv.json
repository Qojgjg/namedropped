But in today’s distracted, fast-paced and digital world, it’s easy for individuals and organizations to act more like thermometers, slipping into reactionary thinking, becoming scattered and inconsistent. The most compelling leaders, teams, organizations, families or collection of humans of any kind operate in thermostat mode. They calibrate their mind and heart to set the temperature for the vision and culture they want to create. Jason Barger, globally celebrated author, keynote speaker and founder of Step Back Leadership Consulting, guides this journey to discover authentic leadership, create compelling cultures and find clarity of mission, vision and values.

        "description": "You, Me, and Your Top Three  is a podcast focused on exploring leadership in the connecting world.  Specifically, the podcast invites leaders to tell stories, reflect, and discuss their views on:\n- disruptions in industry and society;\n- how they are leading transformations considering these disruptions\n- brave leadership to drive transformation.\n\nIt is this last point where we focus most of the discussion, asking our guests to share their insights into the relationships they have with their “Top 3” closest advisors.  It is our observation and experience that as the world connects, the importance of a diverse set of counselors is increasing in value.  For some this may be a formal advisor who has been contracted on behalf of the company.  For most this will be deep relationships in which they have been invested and nurtured.\n\nThrough stories and discussion, we strive to celebrate the art of giving and receiving advice.  The stories that are told are heartfelt and real.  At the root we are exploring the process of knowledge building, relationship building, and perhaps most importantly, confidence building.  After all, it takes a brave leader to battle the inertia that exists in industries, our organizations, and in ourselves.\n\nIt is our hope that as successful leaders open up about around the subjects and the way in which they interact with their closest confidants, that our listeners will, in turn, reflect on their own “virtual board of advisors.”  Over time they will then surround themselves with those who help them stretch toward greatness and lead bravely in the connecting world.",

Aujourd’hui, c’est un macbook dernière génération, un micro calé sur la tête, et une myriade d’outils digitaux.\nCes outils permettent de parfaitement connaître le prospect sans jamais ne lui avoir parlé, d’avoir une liste de compte à appeler priorisé automatiquement, ou encore de recevoir des conseils automatisés réalisé par un IA écoutant tous ses appels.\nAujourd’hui, une vente c’est 20% d’art et 80% de science.\nChaque épisode à un objectif simple : vous apporter au moins un apprentissage à implémenter dès le lendemain pour vendre plus.\nSi c’est le cas : je vous invite à partager cet apprentissage dans la section note et avis sur Apple Podcast. C’est ce qui nous aidera le plus à faire découvrir l’émission à d’autres personnes ambitieuses.\nCe podcast n'aurait pas vu le jour sans nos deux formidables sponsors : Idinvest et Salesforce.\nIdinvest, est le fonds derrière certains des plus gros succès de la tech européenne comme Criteo, Talend, Meero ou encore Lunchr. En quelques chiffres, ce sont plus de 200 startups financées et quelques 200 millions d’euros investis par an dans les plus gros hubs startups européens.\nIdinvest est reconnu pour son agilité et son pragmatisme, c'est pourquoi Jean-Baptiste, le CEO de Criteo, en a même parlé dans son livre \"on m'avait dit que c'était impossible\" en expliquant comment Benoist Grossmann, Partner chez Idinvest, s'était positionné en quelques heures sur son tour de table, lui permettant de bâtir le Criteo que l'on connaît aujourd'hui.\nPour toute question concernant les levées de fonds avec Idinvest, je vous laisse contacter Sophie Bruchou à sbr@idinvest.com.\nSalesforce, c’est LE leader mondial du CRM, et l’outil le plus utilisé pour gérer son pipeline de vente.\nRendez-vous le 10 Septembre pour la sortie du premier épisode !",

BeyondEgo sparks the imagination of dreamers, doers, professionals and entrepreneurs to discuss the idea of \"ego\" healthily as part of the leadership journey.
