Unfortunately, during all those years in medical school and residency, you probably didn't receive a financial education. But, not to worry. That’s where I come in. Think of this podcast as your financial residency without the long hours and sleepless nights! I will guide you through a financial education resulting in money confidence and clarity in this critical aspect of your life. You’ll understand how you make money, how you spend money, how your hard-earned money can work for you, and how to protect yourself and your family. I have witnessed residents and fellows bombarded by life and disability insurance salesmen and other “investment” pitches that are not in their best interest. You didn’t receive any formal financial education in your decades of medical training, so how are you supposed to know the good financial advisors from the bad? This podcast will help with that. Remember, it’s ok to not know the difference between a ROTH IRA and a 403b or which 529 plan is best. This podcast will simplify highly complex concepts and translate industry jargon into plain English. Are you ready to take action and make smarter, more informed financial decisions? Great - let's do this! Let your financial residency begin.",

Is it someone who focuses on innovation? Someone who commits to an idea at all costs? Is it someone who starts something from scratch, improves an existing solution, or disrupts an entire industry? Do all entrepreneurs have a grand mix of ingenuity, persistence, and talent that allows them to be successful? \n\nEntrepreneurs emerge from all different environments. Great ideas are born out of circumstance and challenge. Oftentimes, businesses are created by people who are just trying to find a solution to a problem in their own life. \n\nThrough the many differences among the entrepreneurial community, one thing holds true: all successful entrepreneurs share common characteristics of creativity, drive, a posture of embracing hard work, and the pursuit of reward.\n\nEntrepreneurship will be our episode theme from May to August 2019. Our guests, topics, and dialogue will shed light on the practices entrepreneurs are embracing to create ideas and value that grow their wealth.\n\nLet’s get to work.",

Every Thursday, Jay shares Tulsa Real Estate Fund updates, and interviews experts in the area of business, real estate, and finance. \n\nYou can join the conversation live in two ways: \nDial in 515-604-9995 Pin 640076# \nor\nWatch on Facebook live at www.Facebook.com/TulsaRealEstateFundLLC \n\nThe Tulsa Real Estate Fund (TREF) is the People’s Fund and has proudly begun accepting investments as the FIRST African American owned crowdfunding platform established to revitalize the urban community. TREF provides access to an SEC-regulated & qualified platform to pool our resources in a transparent way. This allows the people an opportunity to finance urban redevelopment in our neighborhoods and combat the displacement of longtime residents and the destruction of our rich culture. \n\nLearn more about the current gentrification cycle by reviewing the Tulsa Real Estate Overview. \n\nIn 2012, President Obama signed the Jobs Act that made this all possible and it was this legislation that eventually opened up real estate investment crowdfunding to non-accredited investors giving average Americans the ability to pool funds as a way to raise capital. \n\nTREF’s mission is to purchase quality real estate projects in distressed neighborhoods, fix them up to sell or buy and hold as rentals providing its investors with an 8% preferred return and 50% share in the profits.\n\nWhile TREF is the first Black-owned SEC-regulated investment fund, this is not the first time that our people have been self-sustaining. On June 1, 1921, the thriving Black Wall Street community in Tulsa, Oklahoma was destroyed. Today, 97 years later, we plan to rebuild ourselves through the Tulsa Real Estate Fund named in honor of that legacy. \n\nOpen your Freedom Account today at www,TulsaRealEstateFund.com and fund your account with as little as $500 (10 shares at $50 per share) plus processing fees.\n\nGENERALLY, NO SALE MAY BE MADE TO YOU IN THIS OFFERING IF THE AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE YOU PAY IS MORE THAN 10% OF THE GREATER OF YOUR ANNUAL INCOME OR NET WORTH. DIFFERENT RULES APPLY TO ACCREDITED INVESTORS AND NON-NATURAL PERSONS. PLEASE SEE OFFERING CIRCULAR.",

        "description": "Value investing is more than an investment strategy — it’s a fundamental way of thinking about finance. Value investing was developed in the 1920s at Columbia Business School by professors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, MS ’21. The authors of the classic text, Security Analysis, Graham and Dodd were the very pioneers of their field and their security analysis principles provided the first rational basis for investment decisions. Despite the vast and volatile changes in the economy and securities markets during the last several decades, value investing has proven to be the most successful money management strategy ever developed. Value investors’ success over the second half of the twentieth century proved not only the validity of the value approach, but its preeminence over even the most widely taught and practiced modern investment theory, which was developed in the 1950s and ’60s and remains dominant even today.\n\nOur mission today is to promote the study and practice of Graham & Dodd’s original investing principles and to improve investing with world-class education, research, and practitioner-academic dialogue. In this podcast you will hear from some of the world’s greatest investors, their views on the investment management industry, how they developed their investment process and how they see the field changing over time.",
