They have a higher demand on their time and more choices on how and from whom they can obtain information due to rapid advances in technology, competition, and social networking. \n \nMary Byers takes a bold, no-nonsense look at the realities of today's marketplace and what it will take for associations to prosper moving forward. She addresses not only the challenges associations face but the actions essential to a thriving future.\n \nSuccessful Associations Today is an interview series with host Mary Byers, CAE.\n \nMary Byers helps associations remain relevant in an increasingly competitive environment.
