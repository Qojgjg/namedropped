It's a term primarily used in modern Japanese in sushi restaurants, where you allow the chef to prepare their own personal favorites, leaving your meal completely in their hands. Wrestling Omakase, therefore, is a show where we place each episode into the hands of one or two passionate fans, from all across the wrestling spectrum. Our regular host John Carroll has over 20 years of diverse wrestling fandom to draw upon, and they will be joined by a revolving door of guests who will share their knowledge and passion for particular promotions or time periods. While our primary focus will be on modern Japanese wrestling, we will also at least touch on wrestling from all over the world, in addition to the occasional episode covering historical periods of various promotions. This is a journey with wrestling fans around the world, bringing you the promotions they know and love the best, and we hope you will join us!\n\nSupport this podcast at — https://redcircle.com/wrestling-omakase/donations",

For far too long, women’s wrestling has not received the attention that it deserves and this is a huge step in the promotion and exposure of the world’s greatest sport. With the advent of this podcast, girls, women and fans of women’s wrestling will have an outlet to learn more about our athletes, their successes and struggles, as well as the lives of our elite competitors outside of the wrestling room. \n\n“Women Wrestle 2” is weekly podcast that will be hosted by recent McKendree University graduate Alexis Porter. Alexis was a four-time All-American at the WCWA level, a three-time Junior National Champion in Fargo, a Junior World bronze medalist and an active competitor on the Senior level. Alexis will be joined by her co-host Arian Carpio, a two-time Cadet Pan-American medalist and 2019 U23 World Team member, who is also training to compete in the 2020 Olympics. \n\nOur hosts, Alexis and Arian, will preview and recap notable women’s wrestling events, feature prominent guests in the women’s wrestling community and discuss other timely topics that are relevant and important to girls and women in our sport. \n\nThe Open Mat is a nationally-respected independent news resource for college, high school and international wrestling.",
