        "description": "Welcome to PaddyTalks, brought to you thanks to www.SeedGolf.com. \nWhat is the Show about? \nI love sport, more specifically golf and those who play it. I have a massive interest into the mind and into the life of Touring professionals, PGA pro's, the top amateurs of the game, but maybe more so I love learning about why people from all walks of life, business and sport and why we play this game of golf. \nIt’s kind of like an unofficial official show, so there will be a structure somewhat but the vibe I’m going for is basically for the listener, that you are listening in on a couple of people having the chats in the kitchen, or in the snug of a pub. A nice relaxed environment where we just want to tell and listen to stories about this game we all love. There are some key topics I’d like to cover personally, but would love to hear what topics you would like to hear discussed and with who! So get into the comments on this show wherever you are listening to it, actually let me know where you are listening to it so I know too! \nIt won’t be just me all the time, I’m looking forward to having my mates and indeed any willing co-hosts please get in touch as from from time to time, when calendars allow, to preview and review the top tournaments as well as discuss certain areas of the game in an in-depth but relaxed format.",
