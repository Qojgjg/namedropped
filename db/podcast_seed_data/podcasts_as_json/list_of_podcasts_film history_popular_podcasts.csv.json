        "description": "In 1973 Hell came home and invaded the body of a young girl. This is the story of a movie and its makers. It's a tale of dark and light, of loss and love. A story of faith and fury, of causes and curses, of horrors real and imagined, of unbridled ego and brute force filmmaking. It's the movie critics called \"religious pornography\" and \"occultist claptrap.\" The movie that left audiences...hysterical. Decades later, it remains perhaps the most frightening movie we will ever see. From Wondery, this is a seven-part deep dive inspired by the story behind an unforgettable, classic movie. This is...Inside The Exorcist.",

The answer to this simple question underlines the complicated reality of film history and the invisibility of women directors. The debates and discussions around women and cinema usually tend to focus on the issues of representation and objectification but what about their authorial voice, their art and aesthetic? What about their creative drive, the decisions that they made and the obstacles that they faced as a director in the masculine world of the Indian film industry?\n\nCine-Maya is a podcast that aims to decode the work and life of women directors, their vision and film language. This special series brings 8 Indian women directors in conversation with Swati Bakshi to discuss their cinematic journey. Episode out every Thursday, starting 10th January 2019.",
