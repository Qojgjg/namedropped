        "description": "The Torah Means Teacher podcast welcomes you!  Please join our discussions and sit in our Torah study class held at Congregation Beth Yeshurun in Houston, TX.  The class is lead and taught by Dr. Nahum Roman Footnick.  Dr. Footnick is not a Rabbi, nor does he work for the synagogue (and his views expressed are not necessarily those of the synagogue).  Rather, in 2010 he was simply invited by the rabbis of the shul to host a class.  A short time after, his classes became quite popular.  Because Dr. Footnick teaches the Torah in manner that makes it accessable for all (Jews, Christians, atheist, and anyone), he was asked to record his sessions for references and for those unable to attend.  Now those recordings are available to all as a FREE podcast.  So, if you have ever had an interest in: God, Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), the Bible, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Atheism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hebrew, Sumer, Philosophy, Psychology, NLP, Hypnosis, Egyptology, Archeology, Science, Miracles, Aliens, Angels, Despotism, Communism, Liberty, Americanism, Israel, Ethics, Morality, Holiness, Goodness, Evil, Free Will, and much, MUCH more then you will enjoy Torah Means Teacher as all these areas are frequently discussed in one manner or another.  Nahum utilizes commentary from many sources.  Most dominant are Dennis Prager, Jacob Milgrom, Nahum Sarna, Umberto Cassuto, Nehama Leibowitz, and of course many other Rabbis like Rashi, Rambam, Ramban, etc.",

        "description": "Now including more than 1600 shiurim, Daf Yomi for Women is the first and only podcast featuring a daily talmud class taught by a woman.\n\n\n\nEach morning, a 45-minute daf yomi class is delivered by Michelle Cohen Farber in Ra’anana, Israel and then immediately posted as a podcast episode.  Additionally, worksheets that organize the daf and help facilitate understanding can be found on the website dafyomi4women.org,  or can be viewed on a mobile device directly from the podcast.  Daf Yomi for Women reaches women who can now have access to a woman's perspective on the most essential Jewish traditional text.  Daf Yomi for Women represents a revolutionary step in advancing women's Torah study around the globe.\n\n\n\nDaf yomi is a system of learning that began in 1923 (initiated by Rabbi Meir Shapiro in Lublin) to learning a page (daf) of Talmud each day in order to complete the entire 2,711 pages of the Talmud in seven and a half years.  Each daf is crammed with lots of information – sometimes a daf has ten different topics and sometimes one topic can be analyzed in great detail, spanning many pages.  \n\n\n\nMichelle Cohen Farber is a graduate of Midreshet Lindenbaum’s scholars program with a BA in Talmud and Tanach from Bar Ilan University. Michelle has taught Talmud and Halacha at Midreshet Lindenbaum, Pelech high school and MATAN. She lives in Ra’anana with her husband and their five children.\n\n\n\nEpisodes are usually posted by 9:20AM Israel time.",

Thus we encourage Torah Living --but Torah Living Y'shua-style. Additionally we provide our listeners with the happenings and goings on in and around the Hebrew Roots communities. We accomplish much of this through Rod Thomas' discussions on his personal life journey as a Hebrew Roots--Disciple of Y'shua Messiah. The True Faith--the Hebrew Roots of the Christian Faith--profoundly affected and changed forever Rod's life and in turn he shares his thoughts and perspectives with you so that you too will experience the tremendous and untold spiritual riches available to each of us who answers the call to true discipleship. We disavow and reject denominationalism at any and every level.  The Bible forms the basis of his perspectives and thoughts. Shalom.",

You now understand all the numeral values of every word in the hebrew language, from Hashem to Moshiach to Satan. (God to Messiah to the Devil). What are you doing with all of this wisdom though? Are you sitting around with your gematria calculator trying to predict whether the 2016 elections with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will cause the final redemption (geula) to start? Or are you learning the lesson's that it's teaching you to become a better person, to grow, to work on your attributes, and to become kinder. The torah is supposed to help us build a relationship with God, and we need to use it for that purpose. Anyone can memorize information, but only some people use the information to take it to their heart and change for the better.",

From weekly D'var Torahs to interviews with some of the most influential voices in animal advocacy and Jewish leadership, you won't want to miss it!\n\n“Shamayim” means “Heaven” in Hebrew. The goal of Jewish life is to bring heaven down to earth and to sanctify the world through all of our just and holy endeavors. The Midrash teaches that there is a temple located in the heavens that sits directly above the temple on earth (Genesis Rabbah 69:7). The same G-d who makes the heavens radiate also illuminates our earthly existence. We are the stewards of the earth seeking to ensure that heaven still has a place on earth by removing injustice, oppression, and suffering from our midst. The animal kingdom is the most abused of all sentient beings. By protecting the most vulnerable creatures on earth, we return the holiness to our world by bringing Shamayim back down to the Aretz, by bringing heaven back down to earth.​",

We seek to generate an experience where students can become intimately familiar with the text and framework of the Mishna. This program will allow students to engage in an introductory in-depth (iyun) study of the Mishna, to understand its emergent laws, and to properly contextualize Torah Shebe’al Peh. This study’s objectives are to increase knowledge of our foundations to Jewish law, to strengthen our sense of awe and love of God, and reinforce our personal and national Jewish identity.",

He speaks from the perspective of \"practical Kabbalah,\" as taught today by Rav Michael Laitman, PhD. Essentially, this is the process of how to reveal Kabbalah's hidden aspect: the Upper Worlds—what is hidden behind our five senses.\n\nKosinec explains that understanding the Kabbalistic \"language of branches\" is the key to starting a practical application of Kabbalah. He also puts across that a misunderstanding of this language is the reason Kabbalah has been misinterpreted in myriad ways—as religion, mysticism, magic, and many others—and that the key to start applying Kabbalah practically is to first understand that its language only describes the Upper Worlds: higher levels of consciousness completely removed from everything we receive through our five senses. From this basis, one can begin learning what one can do in order to attain these higher levels of consciousness. http://www.kabbalah.info http://bit.ly/WwNffE » Click The Link To Start A Free Kabbalah Course.",

Rather “Dial it Down” seeks to create the space for authentic dialogue and human storytelling through personal experiences.",

The short sayings are written from the long books of ‘Zera Shimshon’, in order to make it easier for the learners to have a brief chidush to give over to a friend, at the Shabbos meal with the family or at any time.\n\nThe issue comes out in lashon ha’kodesh, French, and Yiddish. We also assist in the publication of the issue in English by Rabbi Shevach Pepper.\nIn the issue there are unique sections, “The Imrot Shimshon”, “Pniney Shimshon “ which is short tidbits about the Parsha that are scattered throughout the book, Eretz Yishroel, Bais Hamikdash, Tfilla , Shabbos and more. The ‘Gvurash Shimshon’ is special storys of Yeshua from the Baalai Maishe themselves. And a variety other fascinating sections on the “Zera Shimshon”. In the summer we printed another addition “The Avos Shimson” on Mshechesh Avos\nThe issue is printed in Israel, the United States and Europe, in tens of thousands of copies, and is distributed to hundreds of Batai Medresh, Kollels and other public places.\nDue to the great demand at the Mir Yeshiva in Jerusalem, a special distributer was appointed to distribute the issues every weekend. In recent weeks, more than five hundred issues were distributed at the Mir Yeshiva.\nThe issue is published on selected sites, the site ‘Ladaat’ , the site ‘Bainenu’, ‘Print Mail’, and ‘The kuntrest of all elonim’ – the booklet of selected issues that is distributed all over the world.\nWe have been able to issue nearly 200 pamphlets over the past four years, issues that are received with love and affection among the learners.",

The title The Thirteen Petalled Rose is taken from the opening of the classic Jewish text on mysticism, the Zohar, and refers to the \"collective souls of the Jewish people,\" which scholars have likened to the fullness of a rose and its thirteen petals.\n\nIn [The Thirteen Petalled Rose] one can encounter the classical Jewish mystical view of reality, delineated lucidly, concisely, profoundly and, what is so rare, believingly. It is an utterly authentic expression of Judaism yet so unknown even among the well-informed and therefore so necessary, so welcome.\" (Herbert Weiner, Oxford University)\n\nthis podcast is broghut to you by Yeshivat Tekoa under the auspices of the Steinsaltz Center.\n for more information you can visit our website\n\nthe Steinsaltz Center: https://www.steinsaltz-center.org/home/doc.aspx?mCatID=68371\n\nYeshivat teko: https://www.yeshivatekoa.org/\n\n©all rights resevred for The Stiensaltz Center, Rabbi Adin Stiensaltz and The Steinsaltz center.",
