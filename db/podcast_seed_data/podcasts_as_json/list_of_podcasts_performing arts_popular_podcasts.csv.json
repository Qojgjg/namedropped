Following the events of Marvel’s “Wolverine: The Long Night,” Logan (Richard Armitage) returns to New Orleans in search of redemption, only to discover that his ex-lover, Maureen is nowhere to be found. And she's not the only one. Dozens of humans and mutants have gone missing, including the mother of a teenage boy, Marcus Baptiste. With Weapon X in close pursuit, Logan and Marcus must team up and follow a trail of clues that leads them deep into the gothic heart of the bayou, where they encounter biker gangs, Cajun thieves and a world of wonders that defies explanation. It is here that they find Greenhaven -- a refuge run by a powerful mutant named Jason Wyngarde. \n \nAward-winning comic book author Ben Percy (“The Dark Net,” “Red Moon”), director/sound designer Brendan Baker (“Wolverine: The Long Night”) and associate director/sound designer Chloe Prasinos (“Wolverine: The Long Night”) will return for the series, produced by Daniel Fink and Chloe Wilson of Marvel and Jenny Radelet Mast of Stitcher.

I'm proud to say that we've spoken to almost everyone from the original creative team (aka \"The Cabinet\") including the man himself: Lin-Manuel Miranda. In addition, I've had cast members from every company, crew members, musicians, creatives, and the hard working people that keep the production alive. I've also had to pleasure of speaking to experts on the show and its history, some of my superfan friends of note, celebrity Ham enthusiasts, and everything in between. \n\nWhen I started this podcast in January of 2016, I could not have imagined the incredible community that has grown around the show and the amazing experiences that have come my way. Thank you to everyone who has listened, appeared on the show, contributed, or reached out in any way. This podcast is for you and I absolutely love making it. \n\nIf you have any great Ham stories or funny references that you've come across, let me know! Email TheHamilcast [at] gmail [dot] com, or contact me on social media @TheHamilcast. I also have a Patreon that has given rise to the loveliest corner of the internet, ever.

That man was Matt Dillon, U.S. Marshal of Dodge City, Kansas. In Dodge, Dillon was surrounded by hardened, but heartfelt, townsfolk, including his deputy, Chester Wesley Proudfoot; the town physician and mortician, Dr. Charles Adams and, the owner of the Long Branch Saloon, Miss Kitty Russell. Gunsmoke aired for over 9 years and 480 episodes, starred William Conrad, Parley Baer, Georgia Ellis and Howard McNear.",

The 931 episodes broadcast were all based on popular films with the biggest stars of Hollywood playing the parts and during its heyday the audience was estimated as high as forty million.\n\nThe one-and-only Cecil B. DeMille was your host (1936-45) for a lavish production of what was to become a veritable film checklist of many of Hollywoods best films from the mid-30s right through the mid 50s. Every genre is included, from darkest noir crime dramas to historical epics to bubbly musicals and broad comedies. There are some titles that are less known today, and that makes them even more historical.\n\nThe stars of the movie are usually in the productions, although sometimes contracts or schedules meant that another star took the part. In some another star would be featured in one of the major roles. The productions were live, with full orchestra, and many Hollywood legends were unused to performing in public without the benefit of retakes. Needless to say, the performances in every show are singular.\n\nThe Lux Radio Theatre is a masterpiece in OTRs crown, and each show is a historical time capsule that takes us back to the glamour of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",

You push back from the table while coffee is poured. You congregate out on the front porch because it’s cool enough now. Maybe the first sign of what’s to come is a laugh-tinged “You will never believe what happened to me at work...”  Or a wistful “Do y’all remember that time...”  But it always comes. Here, in our little corner of the country, they always come. The South has always marked time by its stories. They carry our history. Our fathers and grandfathers. Wars. Hunting trips. Good dogs. Great loves. Brass badges and bank robbers. Our everyday lives.  Arc Stories is the celebration of that great tradition. It is the chance for our stories to move off the front porch, or from around the campfire, or out of the coffee house, and be put on stage in front of friends and strangers alike.

        "description": "Gunsmoke was a long-running old-time radio and television Western drama program set in Dodge City, Kansas during the settlement of the American West. The radio show first aired on April 26, 1952 and ran until June 18, 1961 on the CBS radio network. The series starred William Conrad as Marshal Matt Dillon, Howard McNear as Doc Charles Adams, Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell, and Parley Baer as Deputy Chester Proudfoot. Doc’s first name and Chester’s last name were changed for the television program. Gunsmoke was notable for its critically acclaimed cast and writing, and is commonly regarded as one of the finest old time radio shows. Some listeners have argued that the radio version of Gunsmoke was far more realistic than the television program. Episodes were aimed at adults, and featured some of the most explicit content of the day: there were violent crimes and scalpings, massacres and opium addicts. Miss Kitty’s occupation as a prostitute was made far more obvious on the radio version than on television. Many episodes ended on a down-note, and villains often got away with their crimes.",

        "description": "The London Necropolis Railway is an original, full cast audio drama podcast that premiered in fall 2018. \n\nThe story takes place in London’s underground system where an organisation called The London Necropolis Railway moves the souls of the dead out of London to avoid the city getting overrun with hauntings.\n\nBarney works at the LNR, he’s one of the ghouls whose job it is to ensure that the souls end up on the trains that take them to the hereafter. He is bored with his job and tired of his endless existence when one day a soul refuses get on the train. The soul, a private investigator named Agnes, convinces Barney to help her catch the demon she was hunting when she died. Together they have to confront his boss, the demon that wants them dead, and even death itself.\n\nThe show is is inspired by the real London Necropolis Railway which was active from the middle of the 1800s to the middle of the 1900s. It was a train line that moved dead bodies out of London to a cemetery 40 minutes outside of the city. The BBC has called it ‘the spookiest, strangest train line in British history.’\n\nThe podcast is part of denandrasidan.se - a project based in Sweden that uses fiction to tackle difficult themes such as death, suicide, and existential questions in a way that makes them approachable for young people.The goal is to create platforms online that can both encourage young people to share their thoughts and emotions around the subject, and to show them that they are not alone in their experiences.\n\nCAST\nAlex Lawther as Barney\nOlga Amelia Silkina as Agnes\nCharlie Vero-Martin as Siobhan\nConnor Jones as the Head Collector\nPatrik Karlson as Peter\n\nCREW\nWriter and Director: Hillevi Gustafson\nSound designer: Mathias Schlegel\nProducer: Amanda Romare\nFirst Assistant Director: Adina Romare\nProduction Assistant: Maja Lindberg\n\nLNR is made possible by the support of Allmänna Arvsfonden, Region Skånes Sociala Investeringsfond, and BoostHbg.",

        "description": "Have Gun Will Travel was a popular American Western television series that aired on CBS from 1957 through 1963. It was the #4 show in the Nielsen ratings in its first year, and #3 for the next three years. It was one of the few television shows to spawn a successful radio version. The radio series debuted on November 23, 1958. The show followed the adventures of Paladin, a gentleman-turned-gunfighter played by John Dehner on radio, who preferred to settle problems without violence, yet, when forced to fight, excelled. Paladin lived in the Carlton Hotel in San Francisco, where he dressed in semi-formal wear, ate gourmet food, and attended opera. In fact, many who initially met him mistook him for a dandy from the East. When working, he dressed in black, used calling cards and wore a holster which carried characteristic chess knight emblems, and carried a derringer under his belt. The knight symbol is of course in reference to his name — possibly a nickname or working name — and his occupation as a champion-for-hire. The theme song of the series refers to him as “a knight without armor.” In addition, Paladin drew a parallel between his methods and the chess piece’s movement: “It’s a chess piece, the most versatile on the board. It can move in eight different directions, over obstacles, and it’s always unexpected.” Paladin was a former Army officer and a graduate of West Point. He was a polyglot, capable of speaking any foreign tongue required by the plot. He also had a thorough knowledge of ancient history and classical literature, and he exhibited a strong passion for legal principles and the rule of law.",

For the past decade, she has been a freelance artist: giving workshops and classes across 7 countries and working on and back stage for both traditional and contemporary circus shows in the US, Portugal, Germany, and Australia.

During these hard times part of the human population has gone sterile. There has been massive inbreeding and genetic distortions. However, teams of scientists and military personnel tasked with finding a way to save humanity from extinction are confronted with a possible opportunity: an exoplanet near the Proxima Centauri system is discovered.  \n\nOver the course of 73 years, this discovery of the exoplanet sparks a series of probe and AI missions--all leading to the realization that a new branch of humanity has arisen on Arca-45672. Now, as the Earth's biosphere collapses, governments and military organizations scramble as they see potential salvation for their dying species in this exoplanet. But should humanity be content to merely survive?",

At least not until a preteen medium accidentally summoned Aya herself to solve the mystery. With no memory of her death and no shortage of questions, Aya must make friends with her fellow ghosts and discover the truth behind the nation's most haunted park. Based on EVP audio recorded by M.A.A.G. (Mothers Against Aliens and Ghosts), Overkill is a comedy podcast, a murder mystery, and a love story all wrapped in one vaguely supernatural package.",

You are about to embark on a journey: A journey reaching deep into the splinter of your mind's eye. You are not in control... we will bend and twist all your perceived thoughts to an unimaginable depth with things only our minds can conceive of... as you travel down the last path to take... the Omega Road.",
