The podcasts are intended to serve as brief introductions or reviews of surgical topics for medical students. We've aimed to cover a single topic in between 10-20 minutes so that you can quickly get a good idea of the basic concepts involved. Every episode is divided into chapters and concludes with several key points to summarize the topic. We are always keen to receive your feedback on our podcasts, and we are accepting suggestions for additional topics. New episodes are published every Friday.\n\n'Surgery 101' was created by Dr Parveen Boora and Dr Jonathan White, and is supported by the Department of Surgery at the University of Alberta. Our 2010 series of podcasts are brought to you by the Undergrad Surgery Mobile Podcasting Studio Team which is: Jonathan, Jenni and Tracy, with the assistance of the Surgery 101 Experts of Edmonton. \n\nNote to experts: please note that these podcasts are only intended as brief introductions for medical students - we cannot delve into the more complex nuances of advanced surgery in a 10-minute podcast. We encourage all listeners to supplement their learning by seeing patients, assisting at surgeries and reading widely!",

The list of career options available to medical students is large, but the time to explore them all is short.  Moreover, mentorship in medical school is lacking, and many medical students tackle the task of career planning alone, most struggling and almost all clutching to the hope that 3rd year clinical rotations will definitively resolve their remaining uncertainties about how they want to specialize. However, having been distracted by the relentless pace of their pre-clinical curricula and specter of Step 1, 3rd year medical students are eventually confronted with the reality that there are simply too many specialties to explore in one year and that they may not even get to finish their clinical rotations before important decisions about their careers need to be made (e.g., the planning of acting internships) if they are to be competitive applicants.  Thus, mentorless and clinically unexposed, many medical students are forced to make wholly uninformed decisions about their futures.  By interviewing at least one physician from each of the 120+ specialties listed on the AAMC's Careers in Medicine website 1) about their specialty, 2) how they decided this specialty was right for them, and 3) for advice about long-term career planning irrespective of the specialty they went into, this podcast aims to enumerate the details of every specialty and provide virtual mentorship on how best to go about moving past being an undifferentiated medical student.",

There is a ton of information regarding treatment techniques, philosophies, and medicine. But how do you separate the fluff from useful relevant information? Our mission is to gain inside(r) input and perspective on all the information floating around from the experts and then dissect it…figuratively. We will present each of these topics and more in an objective way, and then pick them apart to get to the core of what is useful in the clinical setting. We have several prominent guests lined up for interviews to help shed light on various therapeutic topics ranging from joint manipulations, functional training, business ownership while being a clinician, sports rehab and much more. We cover Physical Therapy (PT), Manual therapy, rehab, sports medicine, business practice, and many more topics.

We all know diets don't work. And a few people have given a nod to alternatives, yet these alternatives still preach shrinking of your body in order to gain health and happiness. It's Not About the Food is here to help you uncover the REAL reasons that you're struggling with food and your body image, so that you can create real, lasting peace and happiness from within your soul.... and the food and body will figure itself out. Hosted by board certified psychiatrist and eating disorders specialist, Dr. Stefani Reinold, It's Not About the Food will help you (1) identify what it is you're really struggling with--because, spoiler alert! It's not about the food-- and (2) help you solve those deeper issues.  Dr. Stefani Reinold utilizes her funny, real, down-to-earth, and charismatic personality, as well as her deep-seated Christian faith to educate, encourage, inspire, and motivate... without ever feeling preachy, stuffy, or haughty. She also showcases brilliant, encouraging guests in order to provide real tips to your real solutions... instead of the \"band-aid\" solution that is the diet culture. Intuitive eating, body positivity, mindful eating, and health at every size is the jam. You won't hear politics, feminism, or social justice on this podcast, but you WILL hear some REAL, down-to-earth tips that will not only help you break free from dieting and body hatred, but also, help you live your most authentic, amazing life that God designed for you.",

        "description": "Pharmacology is one of the most challenge topics you will encounter as a healthcare professional, but it can be the most rewarding with a good understanding.  Whether you are preparing to be a nurse, physician, physician assistant, pharmacist, dentist, nurse practitioner, pharmacy technician, pharmacologist, or other healthcare professional, this podcast will help you better understand pharmacology. In addition to giving you the basics like mechanism of action, side effects, drug interactions, etc., you will also be exposed to how medications actually impact patients in real life.  In the Real Life Pharmacology podcast, Eric Christianson, PharmD shares his real world experiences about how a medication's mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and drug interactions can actually impact patients in both a positive and a potentially negative way.  Eric Christianson PharmD is the author of the popular clinical pharmacy blog Meded101.com.  People who are passionate about nursing, medicine, or pharmacy will find this podcast beneficial in helping them prepare for passing exams.  This podcast is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice or intended to be a substitute for medical advice.  Please seek advice from your pharmacist or primary care provider if you have questions about medications that you are taking.",

Utilizing the time tested questions of Rosh Review, Nachi Gupta, MD and Jeff Nusbaum, MD, both Emergency Physicians in New York City, review core emergency medicine concepts to improve listeners’ performance on the boards and in the wards. Going through questions from the question bank, one by one, they dissect not only the question, but also each of the other answer choices, taking advantage of all possible learning opportunities in addition to reviewing key test-taking strategies. At the beginning of each episode, they open with a rapid review of material covered in previous episodes or on the Rosh Review blog. Then, at the end of the episode, they close out with another rapid review of topics covered during the episode. Spaced repetition at its finest. This podcast is ideal for the emergency physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, EMT, and medical student who works in the Emergency Department or has an interest in emergency medicine. Give it a listen….you won’t be disappointed.",

        "description": "These videos teach the fundamentals of a dynamic warm up.  Dynamic Warm Ups involve movement, rather than static stretching, to prepare your body for what you will actually do in the upcoming workout, utilizing activity or sport specific movements.  Dynamic warm ups also target areas of the body that tend to be tight or locked down: the goal is to open them up so they are able to load and unload your body weight safely and efficiently.  \nBecause life and sport happen in all three planes, we need to warm up and train in all three planes of motion.  These dynamic warm ups use a matrix system, where we tweak different fundamental movements in all three planes.  For a general dynamic warm up, we focus on getting proper motion in the foot/ankle, hips and thoracic spine.  We use different body parts as what we’ll call drivers, to drive the body through movement.  \n We have classified the movements based on the number of points of contact, or external stability.  Level 1 movements have 3 points of contact, such as two hands on the wall and one foot on the ground, while the other foot is used as a driver.  Level 2 movements have just 2 points of contact: typically two feet on the ground using the upper body and arms as drivers.  Level 3 movements will have one or no points of contact.  These activities include some sort of locomotion, or flight phase, like lunging, running, or shuffling.  The final level, four, incorporates some type of overload with these movements, such as driving a dumbbell with the arms. A well- designed Dynamic Warm Up uses a combination of different levels, while tweaking in all three planes of motion, to address movement through the foot/ankle, hips, and thoracic spine.\nThese Dynamic Warm Ups start by isolating each target area, using all three planes of motion.  Examples of each of the levels will help you see how to warm up using three, then two and then one or no points of stability.  The goal is to allow the body to “move” and work as it was intended to – with integrated and sequential movement patterns, rather than isolating individual body parts. The Dynamic Warm Up trains movement, not muscles – which should improve performance, whether you are a world class athlete or a beginning exerciser.       \n**Acknowledgement**      Dixie Stanforth, Ph.D., directs the undergraduate Specialization in Personal Training at UT Austin.

But are either of those a good thing?\n\nDr. Simpson is not only a renown weight loss surgeon, but he's also a certified Culinary Medicine Specialist. That means he spends more time teaching patients to cook than he does operating on them. \n\nCulinary Medicine separates out the legitimate science and medicine of food from those who would seek to practice medicine without a license. Where today's nutritional advice is the realm of hucksters, Dr. Simpson is taking it back to the realm of science.  \n\nEach episode will bust myths about food as he gives honest answers to questions like... can you really taste soil in wine? (No.) Are cranberries a treatment for urinary tract infections? (Maybe). Occasionally, Dr. Simpson will be joined by Food Network Stars like Simon Majumdar, or leaders in culinary medicine like John La Puma.",
