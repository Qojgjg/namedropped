Whether the featured performers are funny, informative, political, or completely personal, the anonymous confessions from the audience are the stars of every show.\nSelected from our live shows, each podcast features one storyteller bookended with anonymous confessions from the audience that are read (and often commented upon) during the evening. All BedPost Storytelling Productions are made accessible to deaf audience members by the fantastic interpreters from SOULumination. Though the interpreters are there to serve the deaf, they enthrall the entire audience with their beautiful expressions of American Sign Language. If you hear a roar of laughter and don't understand why, the interpreter may have stolen the show for a minute.",

We affirm that codependency or labeling a woman as codependent is a form of victim blaming. We help women who are in a relationship, separated or divorced navigate what to do. Pornography addiction / sex addiction, infidelity, and cheating are not a couples issue - they're a domestic abuse issue. Narcissistic abuse is not a communication issue. We help our clients recover by establishing safety in their lives and families through boundaries in whatever form that takes. Every woman on our team has experienced abuse and betrayal trauma first hand. BTR is a 501(c)(3) non-profit. For past podcasts visit our website: btr.org",

Whether it's more meaning, a bigger impact, unshakable confidence, a hotter sex life, more money, deeper love, solid friendships or a powerful legacy…\n\n \n\nWhat is true success? How can a man actually reach the end of his life and look back without regret -- having lived and loved fully, rather than having been stuck in fear or a life he was \"supposed to\" lead? Man Alive is a series of bold, raw and gritty conversations with experts on success, power, sex, love and legacy.\n\n \n\nFor the past 15 years Shana James, a dating and relationship expert, has worked with thousands of men and women around the world and collaborated with hundreds of teachers and coaches. She has led workshops for dating companies like Table for Six and Match.com and been matchmaker for an MTV reality show.\n\n\n\nShana doesn't buy into the need for rules, games or limitations. She works with men individually to find their unique power, confidence and leadership abilities, breaking open the boxes that keep them stuck, dissatisfied, or settling for less than amazing in any area of life.",

Our conversations dive into the confusing nature of growing up in Mormonism where sexuality is taught as something that's beautiful and sacred, but can only be explored after you're married- usually very quickly in between the temple sealing and the reception in the back of an '88 Mercury Tracer. Recorded in Los Angeles, we speak with post-mormons, ex-mormons, jacked-mormons, and active mormons alike about their parents' timid explanations of where babies come from, awkward bishop interviews that mostly focus on masturbation, first sexual experiences, current outlook on sex, and more.",
