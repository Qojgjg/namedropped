        "description": "My audio log where I monologue about manga! (Talk about a mouthful... A mouthful of manga, that is! Wait, what...?)\n\nThis is a beginner-friendly one-man show that ranges anywhere from 20-30 minutes in length. Introduces a new manga series each episode (but avoids any serious spoilers). \n\nIt's just me, but it doesn't have to be! Listener participation is highly encouraged! Send questions, feedback, recommendations, or your own thoughts on the series I'm covering. (Don't worry, I announce it at the end of each episode, so you can get a head start.)",
