        "description": "Life's not easy for Doug Eiffel, the communications officer for the U.S.S. Hephaestus Research Station, currently on Day 448 of its orbit around red dwarf star Wolf 359. He's stuck on a scientific survey mission of indeterminate length, 7.8 light years from Earth. His only company on board the station are stern mission chief Minkowski, insane science officer Hilbert, and Hephaestus Station's sentient, often malfunctioning operating system Hera. He doesn't have much to do for his job other than monitoring static and intercepting the occasional decades-old radio broadcast from Earth, so he spends most of his time creating extensive audio logs about the ordinary, day-to-day happenings within the station. But the Hephaestus is an odd place, and life in extremely isolated, zero gravity conditions has a way of doing funny things to people's minds. Even the simplest of tasks can turn into a gargantuan struggle, and the most ordinary-seeming things have a way of turning into anything but that. Wolf 359 is a radio drama in the tradition of Golden Age of Radio shows. Take one part space-faring adventure, add one part character drama, and mix in one part absurdist sitcom, and you get Wolf 359. New episodes are released every two weeks.",

Season 1's 11-part fictional podcast serial was just the beginning of the cliff-hanger science fiction fun. Season 2 drops March 5. While Marian and Mason are trying to adjust to their new role as guardians of the Genesis device, the nation is faced with a new threat. Someone or something is able to jump from one body to the next, allowing them to infiltrate high-security military installations and leaving a trail of bodies behind. No one knows what they are looking for or how to stop them. Having no other options, the President of the United States seeks Marian’s help with the hope that she can use her newfound abilities to track down this elusive enemy. Marian reluctantly agrees and is then on a path that eventually causes her to question whether or not the Hosts of Eden are the only ones who want the bodies of mankind. ",

But what if those abilities came from inside you, from the very worst part of you, and there was nothing you could do to control them? What if every time you tried to help someone, things spiraled out of control, and all you did was cause more damage? \n\n\nRecognized by the Austin Film Festival, Super Ordinary is the story of a girl who finds out she has super powers, only to find out that they’re connected to her debilitating panic attacks, and therefore nearly uncontrollable. This narrative podcast serves as Anika’s attempt to tell her side of the story after having already been cast as a villain in her world.\n\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook @superordpod\n\n\nhttp://www.superordinarypod.com",

Now the city consists of towers where the wealthiest residents live at the top while the poor eke out a living on the ground. Our podcast follows Cas, Shaima, and Argus, three brothers who live with their Uncle Vern after being orphaned during the grounder rebellion twenty years earlier. They find themselves drifting apart as Argus, the youngest, falls hopelessly in love with the much-older Helina, a foreign merchant haunted by her past; Cas, the middle brother, works in secret for the local crime boss; and Shaima, the oldest, struggles to keep their uncle’s scrap shop from going under. When Cas’s best friend, Kendall, is offered a position with the Wolfpac, Windfall’s military cult that acts as the city’s police, Cas is forced to decide where his loyalties lie. Meanwhile, something sinister looms over the city itself, threatening the lives of all who live in Windfall, from the wealthiest residents to the ground-level poor. Start at Episode 1.00.",

After living in a tiny outpost her whole life, little could have prepared Harper for what her and Kane find on the other side of town. And what else is about to come her way.  TWOTW is set a thousand years in the future, in a world where nature has returned to itself, and where humanity hangs on by a thread. Now everyone abides by the Gospel of Gara. Because no one wants to repeat humanity's history, at least, if you believe what the Gospels say.",

The term \"The Wild West\" was coined because of the constant conflict between Werewolf, Druid and Vampire. The poor Humans were simply caught up in the crossfire of the times.

Adams (Suits), Sarah Wright Olsen (American Made), Brett Dier (Jane the Virgin), Christa B.

Music by Deborah Lurie (Wanted) with performances by Tina Guo (Dunkirk), Gretchen Menn, and Steve Tavaglione (The Maze Runner). Sound effects design by Sean Beavan (Lost Highway). Directed by Babar Peerzada. Post-production by A.G.E. Post.\n \n* * *\n\nVANT HU’L IS CURSED. Dragged to the center of a wasteland by a ruthless malevolence, the legendary warrior discovers a cavern filled with devious riddles and fiendish traps. Upon solving the labyrinth, he is confronted by a hideous creature. A beast with unimaginable abilities. A being of unspeakable evil… DEATH.\n\nWithout a shred of clemency, the demigod presents Vant with a choice: do his sinister bidding out in the world, or suffer an eternity of horrifying torment. Thus begins Vant’s quest out of the badlands, through the hostile wilderness, into the clutches of twisted townships, and finally toward conflict with the vile stewards of a corrupted civilization.\n\nBut Vant will not go it alone. In the midst of his journey, he develops an unlikely companionship with a clever and venturesome teenage girl, the expert survivalist Skii Tavee. They also form an alliance with two newfound⁠—but questionable⁠—⁠companions: Kram Grammie, the sneaky con man who is as crafty as he is klepto, and an off-kilter eccentric bizarrely known as The World’s Worst Magician. United, they set out to dispatch their foes, rescue the innocents caught in the crossfire, and unite the forces of a world gone astray, all while reconciling with their own haunting pasts.\n\nMortal Enemy is an experience like no other. It is a relentless whirlwind of action and adventure. A tale of conflicted heroes and dastardly villains. A story rich with darkness and struggle, yet filled with devilishly wicked humor. It is jam-packed with nightmarish scenarios, fantastical environments, rich mythology, incredible weapons, unique technologies, and characters dripping with personality… with shocking surprises awaiting you at every turn.\n\nCome experience Death… if you dare.",

There is no music, and no sound effects; instead, the show invites you to engage more fully in the 'shared hallucination' of the words. Season 1 tells the story of Elandra Ramirez, a young First Arcanist of the United Star Systems Alliance. Sent across the galaxy to learn the truth about a household android that has purportedly begun practicing magic, she soon finds herself ensnared in a cultural and political upheaval that stretches to the furthest reaches of colonized space. \"There's a state of mind that you enter when you're listening to a story; it's a state of passive acceptance, where you sit there and you get to make your own exciting movie. You get to watch it be built for you in front of you.\"",
