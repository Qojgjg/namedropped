I’m Matthew, and I’m Stephen.\nWe are Plant Daddies living in Seattle, WA, podcasting about our passion for cultivating plants. Since our identities are intersectional, and [we'd like to think] include much more than just being gay millennial Plant Daddies, we'll also get into pop culture, LGBTQ+ content, current events, and our own personal stories. We chat with such guests as gardening, botany and horticulture experts, amateur potted plant hobbyists, professionals in the houseplant industry, and some of our unsuspecting friends. We are going to teach, learn, and share. Up to 30% non-botanical content by volume.",
