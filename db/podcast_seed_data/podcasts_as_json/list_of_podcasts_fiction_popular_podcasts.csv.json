Puck, he confides this previously undisclosed tale to the only surviving relation of his former team, Alex Robbins, the son of Puck’s friend Anthony. Over the course of ten episodes, the show will not only relate past tales of heroics, horror, and humor, but also sets the stage for future characters.\n\nIn Goldrush, fans will truly get to know these well-beloved characters characters on a much more emotionally satisfying level. Their humor and unique group dynamic certainly remain intact, and modeled after old Spaghetti Westerns, the story takes directions the series has not yet explored.\n\nFilled with action, battles with the undead, love triangles, conflicting loyalties, and of course gold, WE’RE ALIVE: GOLDRUSH stands out as a truly unique Theater for the Mind experience for both new and old listeners.",

        "description": "Life's not easy for Doug Eiffel, the communications officer for the U.S.S. Hephaestus Research Station, currently on Day 448 of its orbit around red dwarf star Wolf 359. He's stuck on a scientific survey mission of indeterminate length, 7.8 light years from Earth. His only company on board the station are stern mission chief Minkowski, insane science officer Hilbert, and Hephaestus Station's sentient, often malfunctioning operating system Hera. He doesn't have much to do for his job other than monitoring static and intercepting the occasional decades-old radio broadcast from Earth, so he spends most of his time creating extensive audio logs about the ordinary, day-to-day happenings within the station. But the Hephaestus is an odd place, and life in extremely isolated, zero gravity conditions has a way of doing funny things to people's minds. Even the simplest of tasks can turn into a gargantuan struggle, and the most ordinary-seeming things have a way of turning into anything but that. Wolf 359 is a radio drama in the tradition of Golden Age of Radio shows. Take one part space-faring adventure, add one part character drama, and mix in one part absurdist sitcom, and you get Wolf 359. New episodes are released every two weeks.",

Each episode is organized around a kind of apocalypse, whether the cataclysm is planetary or personal, and each episode is also set in succeeding centuries, with 99-year intervals separating them. Zero Hours begins in the past, catches up to the present, and eventually overtakes it. Some installments are darkly comedic, others grimly contemplative, and others still thrillingly contentious. But they all explore the same question: how do we keep going when the world is crashing down around us?Stories From The End(s) of the World...",

Quickly, the investigation grows out of their control, as they discover that, not only are the legends seemingly true, many people in Blackwood have turned up dead or disappeared without a trace. Worse, there may be a reason why no one has ever uncovered the truth before. Someone is watching them, willing to do whatever it takes to keep the secret. Their recordings have finally been released.",

        "description": "We all know the story of the charming underdog who gets blessed with powers beyond their control after a freak accident and spends the rest of their life fighting for the greater good of mankind. But what if those abilities came from inside you, from the very worst part of you, and there was nothing you could do to control them? What if every time you tried to help someone, things spiraled out of control, and all you did was cause more damage? \n\n\nRecognized by the Austin Film Festival, Super Ordinary is the story of a girl who finds out she has super powers, only to find out that they’re connected to her debilitating panic attacks, and therefore nearly uncontrollable. This narrative podcast serves as Anika’s attempt to tell her side of the story after having already been cast as a villain in her world.\n\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook @superordpod\n\n\nhttp://www.superordinarypod.com",
