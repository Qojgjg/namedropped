The notoriously irreverent comedian Richie Redding and celebrity veterinarian Dr. Lisa Lippman are unlikely cohosts... and also a loving couple. The result is an extremely informative show that is surprisingly funny. Each episode features high profile guests telling hilarious stories of the pets that shape their lives. They also get real vet advice from Dr. Lisa and get to play stump the doctor with all the silliest animal questions they have. (You'll learn a TON about sex and poop). This is the least narcissistic interview possible! Instead of talking about themselves, guests get to talk about the thing that makes us human: their love for life's furry little family members… and these jumping off points highlight more of their personalities than we might think.",

We educate you on how to modify unwanted cat behavior by providing the proper environment and stimulation, enabling cats to express their natural behaviors in ways that are preferable for both the humans and cats. You will learn how to have fun with your cat, fascinating cat facts and be inspired to try new things, which will lead to a happier relationship and closer bond with your cat. We’ll also call attention to the plight of cats in our country, feel compassion for their challenges and share the message.",
