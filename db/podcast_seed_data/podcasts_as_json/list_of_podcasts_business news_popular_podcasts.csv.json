Differentiation – 1) Large comprehensive selection of topics including financial accounting, managerial accounting, tax, and small business tips. 2) Use of trial balance and chart of accounts including an explanation to understand more concepts as they relate to the accounting process as a whole, including the double entry accounting system, the chart of accounts, and debits and credits. Many books and resources focus on very limited aspects of a topic leaving us with little understanding of how it fits into the double entry accounting system, how it relates to debits and credits, and how it would be journalized to a trial balance. We make an effort to show these accounting relationships. \n\nLearning Philosophy – Accounting is learned best by doing. Much of accounting should be learned with the use of electronic spreadsheets such as Excel or Google Sheets. Learning accounting is also the best way to learn how to use electronic spreadsheets. These are not 2 separate activities to be learned in isolation from each other, but rather they should be learned at the same time, so open up Excel or sign up to a free Google Sheets account and let’s work some problems.\n\nObjectives:\n\n• Provide learning resources to any user including accounting students, users who work in an accounting department or firm, or anybody who wants to learn more about accounting, and or, Excel\n\n• Allow users to locate what they need in a quick and easy way\n\n• Provide example problems which break down concepts into learnable parts\n\n• Provide example problems that explain the use of electronic spreadsheets like Excel so that users can learn how to use these applications within a practical context\n\n• Provide lectures that discuss accounting topics\n\n• Provide reading material to explain accounting topics",

Podcast host Caroline Stokes, Author of Elephants Before Unicorns: Emotionally Intelligent HR Strategies To Save Your Company (Entrepreneur Press, 2019) has been in the heart of tech internationally for 27 years and advocates for organizations to adopt tech in order to achieve benchmarks faster. Many EI Recruiter podcast conversations spotlight various new technologies that can enhance your company’s operations.\n\nBut tech is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. At the EI Recruiter we believe that if work is to be meaningful, it has to first be human.  Beyond tech, this podcast was created to help develop the many lenses of emotional intelligence to move you and your company forward.\n\nIn Season One, we spoke with guests across the emotional intelligence spectrum. We talked to bestelling authors including Kim Scott, Dorie Clark, Warren Berger, David Meade, Darrell West, Marshall Goldsmith, and Dr. Annie McKee with the goal of helping people leaders learn to adapt to the changing landscape of work. We also spoke about the tech and marketing aspect of business with employer brand leaders including Graeme Johnson, Erin Wilson, Bryan Chaney, and machine learning leaders including Beth Porter, Ulrik Juul Christiansen, Dr Charles Handler, and Raghav Singh. \n\nThe conversations were enlightening, entertaining, and inspiring. They are required listening for any people leader wanting to increase emotional intelligence to improve their company’s performance. Our conversations spotlighted the latest trends in organizational leadership; knowing these trends will enhance your ability to compete in the talent wars.\n\nSeason Two springboards off the first season to do a deeper dive on the challenges facing people leaders on the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution.\n\nWe are excited to have you join the conversation.",

Hosts of The Conejo Podcast show, as business owners themselves, had an interest in meeting other smart business owners and fascinating entrepreneurs. When they started to reach out to these people, and started talking to them, they quickly realized others needed to hear their stories too. They could not keep this great information to themselves. These were experts in their respective fields, smart and intelligent, not to mention, many had discovered unique ways to impact the lives of their customers, clients, and patients. So they asked, “Why not share these stories? Why not interview these people? Create a Podcast? Why not create a site where they could be posted and listened to?” Additionally, Jay and Michelle have a lot of opinions and stories about their lives, the world around them, their core beliefs in philanthropy and volunteering. They love to share those opinions, stories, and rants, as well as hear and talk about the opinions and stories of their listeners who write into the show. With that, the concept for The Conejo Podcast Show was born. For more, visit: www.TheConejoPodcast.com.",

        "description": "Our world is experiencing a tsunami of digital disruption—shaking the very foundations of established institutions, industries and service-based businesses. A recurring theme affecting each is the shifting role and ultimate value of experts and intermediaries in this technology-driven, highly networked ecosystem.\n\nWelcome to The Next Frontier podcast where we’ll break down and analyze the forces at work in our world, our culture and our businesses. Our goal is to unlock the challenges to reveal the opportunities and what it means to provide advice in the 21st century. In each episode, we’ll examine this rapidly evolving reality with probing questions like: \n\n~How is the digitization of our world altering clients’ sentiments and expectations? \n~How is the business of “advice” and “guidance” coping with and preparing for this stark reality? \n~What are the new and different skills, methods and insights that will redefine the value of the human intermediary—both professionally and personally? \n~Where will high tech and high touch intersect in your business? \n~Is the digitization of our lives redefining trust?\n\nDisclosure:\nThis content is provided for general informational purposes only.

Firstly, there is an informative round up of the latest financial crime news discussed by the host and two guest contributors. Guests will give their perspective on why the latest news matters, pointing to long-term trends and what these could mean for different stakeholders. The second half of the podcast will deep-dive into a new piece of financial crime research. This one-to-one interview between the host and lead researcher will offer “behind-the-scenes” insights and practical advice on how to implement the latest financial crime research in the real world.",

Eine Meinung hat natürlich jeder, doch abseits des Gefühls, dass hier etwas schief läuft, fand und findet wenig substanzielle Debatte statt.\n\nDie Berichte über das Finanzsystem und die Wirtschaft mehren sich, wenn das Jubiläum einer Finanzkrise ansteht, die Pleite eines großen Arbeitgebers droht oder tausende Anleger ihr Geld in obskuren Finanzanlagen des grauen Kapitalmarktes versenkten.\n\nUns interessiert nicht die Nachricht, sondern das, was hinter der Nachricht steht. In diesem Sinne wandelt sich auch der Podcast. Es begann mit einer wöchentlich erscheinenden Gesprächsrunde. Doch wir merkten immer wieder, dass dies zu wenig ist. Daher wollen in Zukunft vermehrt die verschiedenen Perspektiven auf ein Thema sichtbar machen.\n\nDie Erneuerung der Internetseite ist hierzu ein Vorläufer. Weitere Neuerungen sind bis Ende 2018 geplant und werden dann hier aufgeführt.\n\nDamit es diesen Podcast weiterhin geben kann,  benötigen wir deine Spende!",
