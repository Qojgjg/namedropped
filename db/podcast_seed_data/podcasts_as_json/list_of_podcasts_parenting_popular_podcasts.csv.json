        "description": "Minimal-ish is a podcast about minimalism...sort of. It's the podcast that encourages you to let go of material things and clear out your space to make room for what matters. Believe it or not, your stuff takes up your time, and cluttered spaces can be a source of anxiousness. Fill your life with the people and things that you love, and get rid of the rest. Through conversations with other women and moms on the same simple-living journey, the Minimal-ish podcast will encourage you towards the grace-filled, realistic form of minimalism that benefits your life and family most. \n\nBut it's not just about getting rid of your stuff or tidying up your home. There's so much more. Minimalism allows you to make room to live the life you want. This podcast discusses how to live the intentional life you want to live through simplifying in every area- how to make room so you can tell the story you want to tell with the life you've been given. \n\nYour host, Desirae Endres, is a stay at home/ work at home mom, teacher, and writer that believes that minimalism and having an uncluttered home environment can benefit everyone, but it doesn't look the same for everyone. Minimalism has changed her life, and if she can make minimalism attainable and sustainable in her life, anyone can. She brings honesty and transparency to the conversation as an admittedly (formerly-ish) unorganized, messy and anxious person as she discusses topics of minimalism, intentional, creative  living, motherhood, and more.  \n\nGrab a cup of coffee & listen in!",

We’re both moms of three, dealing with the same hassles as any parent, albeit with slightly differing styles. Margaret is laid-back to the max; Amy never met an expert or a list she didn't like. In each episode, we discuss a parenting issue from multiple perspectives and the accompanying expert advice that may or may not back us up. We talk about it, laugh about it, call out each other’s nonsense, and then we come up with concrete solutions. Join us as we laugh in the face of motherhood!

We share resources that we found tremendously helpful for understanding our birthing options. We confess the magic and craziness in preparing for pregnancy, home birth, motherhood and fatherhood. We talk about having sex while pregnant and maintaining your connection and intimacy as a couple. We reveal how to stay centered and not lose yourself through pregnancy, and tons more! This show is all about adding an empowered conversation to the topic of home birth and natural birth, while keeping it real, grounded and fun. So strap in and join us as we’re doing it at home!",

The show’s guiding principle is that raising healthy children starts with a parent's self examination of the experiences and beliefs that influence their parenting, and that helping children reach their own potential begins with a parent’s aspiration - and ability - to reach their own. Dynamic, passionate, and inspiring, Dr. Dan and his guests will discuss diverse and timely parenting topics weekly and each episode teach listeners how to sculpt their best and most authentic “Parent Footprint.”",

        "description": "Andrea Olson of Go Diaper Free explains elimination communication - the concept of pottying your baby, as early as birth - which is what people have done for all of human history and in today’s world where there are no diapers. She makes it easy to integrate EC into your modern lifestyle as a new parent, demystifies how to know your baby needs to go, how to take them to the toilet instead of primarily relying on the diaper, and makes EC approachable, accessible, and fun, for all parents...whether part-time, with or without diapers, and in any region of the world. Contrary to popular marketing messages, diapers are tools, not toilets, and babies are ALL born “ready” to use the toilet. Learn how to connect with your baby on this very natural level with Andrea’s expert guidance, and experience the freedom of a life without dependence upon diapers, a life without traumatic toilet training, a life where your baby gets a head start on developing motor skills, communication, and learning by prioritizing this age-appropriate skill (0-18 months). EC honors your baby’s dignity and makes parenting THAT much easier! Stop changing blowouts...and learn how to listen to your baby’s requests for good hygiene. Learn more at godiaperfree.com. (PS - Andrea also occasionally covers potty training, for those of you who find us after 18 months.)",

As a lover of truth and all things dark comedy, she and special guests partake in real talk about everything relating to motherhood – marriage post kids, birth, the never-ending micromanagement of screen time, sex, chronic-illness, Snoop Dogg, social issues, homeschooling, meditation, the revolt of the aging uterus, postpartum depletion, writing, the joke that is half-day kindergarten, and more. This is not a podcast with annoying parenting advice. Instead, Adult Conversation aims to break down the façade of “perfect” parenting with its balanced mix of wit, inappropriateness, compassion and validation, and can be considered a form of self-care, especially when listened to while locked in a bathroom alone. Or if your people will stage a full-on revolt at being separated from you, pop in some earbuds while folding laundry, wiping butts or waiting in the carpool line. Warning: this podcast  can be inappropriate, just like parenting.",

Most of us were parented in this way but there is a shift in thinking about the way we raise our kids.  Parents don’t feel good about using shame, blame, criticism, punishments, and even rewards, to get their kids to listen.  Parents are wanting a different way because they know from their own childhoods this type of parenting hurts and leaves us with scars we take with us through our adulthood.  \n\nEach one of my episodes is designed to help you navigate the difficult journey of parenting but in a way that is more peaceful and intentional.  I’ll show you how to get your kids to listen and cooperate without yelling, punishments and rewards.  I’ll show you how to understand your own feelings and those of your kids.  \n\nMy intention is to bring you to a place where you feel connected with your kids and yourself (we often get lost when we become parents!).  Tune in weekly for all the inside tips, tools and tricks I teach my private clients to help you build the family you always wanted, and to become the parent you always envisioned you would be.  I promise to provide you with fun and entertaining content that will leave you seeing your kids and your reactions in a whole new light!  \n\nPlease make sure to share the episodes that give you goosebumps, and leave you feeling inspired!  I am always grateful for every person who subscribes, leaves a review and rates my podcast 5 stars.",

Listen in and you’ll get practical life hacks, gain insight, and laugh with them as they give you the tools you need to succeed in business, marriage, and parenting.\nThe busy parents of two have been together for 17 years, married for 8, and here’s what they know for sure: there’s a spark that ignites inside when you follow your passion...and when that happens for you, you’re unstoppable. Their mission is to inspire, motivate, and guide you to ignite that spark within yourself by sharing their stories along with interviewing other power couples.\nThis dynamic duo is on fire and they are going to share how you can have a ride or die attitude. \n\nA message from Brandon and Sam:\n\n“Look, life gets crazy!  We get it, when you’re being pulled in a million different directions, most people will just quit. But you’re different, that’s why you’re here.  You need to remember at the end of the day, the good this life has to offer always outweighs the bad. We have found that when you approach life with positivity, proactivity, fearlessness, and love, you can get what you want as long as you are willing to put in the work it takes to get there.”\n\nMake sure to stay connected with us!\n\nDownload their podcast on iTunes here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/middleton-methods-podcast/id1185297770\n \nBlog: http://RideOrDieCouples.com\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/rideordiecouples\nTwitter: @BrandonAndSam\nInstagram: @brandonandsam",

I wanted to start this podcast because I wanted to create a place for moms to remember who they are, what they are doing and capable of, and know that they are absolutely not alone in this journey. Join me as I interview other moms in all different mom situations that you will surely find relatable. I also share some of my motherhood stories and experiences with you because surely I'm not the only one who's had a screaming kid in the grocery store or ordered pizza again because it was a long busy day with the kids.

We’re 3 sisters who wanted to do something to counter the culture of mom-shaming and unrealistic expectations for mothers. So what if you breastfeed or bottle feed? Work out of the home or in the home? Send your kids to private or public school? As sisters who were raised by the same mom and dad in the same home but who have unique parenting styles, we know that there’s no right way to raise kids. But we’ve felt empowered as we’ve learned from each other and other moms through respectful dialogue, and we want to let you in on our conversations. Join us as we discuss the hot topics of motherhood in a judgment-free zone. And learn with us as we interview women from diverse backgrounds about how they mother. Let’s open our minds to new ideas while laughing (and maybe peeing ;) along the way.\nLove!\nAyo, Mika, and Jaclyn",

As this Noise in our world accelerates, what impact will it have on our children’s wellbeing – and their future?  What will our children need in order to create a happy, successful, and more balanced life?  One thing is certain – it won’t come from apps, devices, or social media followers. \n\nTo create a positive and fulfilling future in a world controlled by tech, media and consumerism will require something not taught in schools – a new kind of IQ.  We call it The Inner IQ – a critical set of inner qualities that protect and prepare children for the future.\n\nIf you’re a parent concerned about how to best help your children grow into resilient, successful adults who can thrive in our digital age, the most important thing you can do is to help them develop their Inner IQ.   \n\nThat’s what this timely podcast by developmental and educational psychologist, Dr. Rob Reiher, and host, Wayne Yercha, is all about.  Based on the latest science, and on Dr. Reiher’s decades of work and research at the top levels of the kids’ media and entertainment industries, LIVE ABOVE THE NOISE is a step-by-step action plan for parents looking for ways to protect and prepare their children for the future.",
