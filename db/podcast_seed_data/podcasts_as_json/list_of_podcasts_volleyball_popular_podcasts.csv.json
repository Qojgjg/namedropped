Despite having less than two million people, it is not unusual for there to be more young women, per capita, playing college volleyball from Nebraska than any other state. How has this happened? We talk with college coaches, high school coaches, and former players to gain insight into this phenomenon. This is not a story that focuses on technical skills or tactics, but rather a story about passion, vision, and leadership that understands the difference between talent and skill. Whether you are an athletic coach, or the leader of a business team you will find this series compelling.",
