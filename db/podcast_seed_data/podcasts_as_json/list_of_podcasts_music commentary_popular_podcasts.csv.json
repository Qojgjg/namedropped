        "description": "This is an in-depth-yet-entertaining dive into the lyrics and narrative artistry of Kanye West's music. We go track by track through Ye's discography, revealing the narrative and poetic techniques he uses, tracking his growth as a storyteller, and illuminating the narratives behind Yeezus and The Life of Pablo. For Kanye fans, this might be the Ye-centric lyrical discussion you've been waiting for. For musicians and writers, this is practical insight into how one of the best storytellers in music history does what he does. We also have a news show about Kanye, Kim, North, Saint, and Jay-Z. We look at the top 5 posts from Reddit's Kanye community, r/Kanye. And discuss other relevant Ye topics. And there's our interview series, My StorYe, where we interview people about their relationship with Kanye West. We hope you enjoy!",

The goal of the show is twofold: Fold #1: To help others fully appreciate the works of the world’s greatest indie rock band, and Fold #2: to someday, perhaps meet the podcast's namesake - Stephen Malkmus.\n\n\nSupport this podcast at — https://redcircle.com/meeting-malkmus-a-pavement-podcast/exclusive-content",

Call it post-punk, or new wave, but from 1978 to 1984 bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees, PiL, Gang of Four and Joy Division were re-defining what was possible in this brave new musical landscape of machines, rhythms and electronics. In turns affectionate, amusing and anecdotal, our own Gang of Three former amateur indie musicians dissect the albums, songs and tours that made this experimental era one of the most important in rock history, scattering their own personal recollections and insights amongst the facts along the way.\n \nEver wondered why The Cure’s Robert Smith was playing two shows a night in different bands, where a bridge for suicidal dogs in Scotland fits in to the Talking Heads story, or how the Human League’s Phil Oakey started a nipple piercing craze? We’ll tell you, and more.\n \nWelcome to Known Pleasures - this is the way, step inside.",
