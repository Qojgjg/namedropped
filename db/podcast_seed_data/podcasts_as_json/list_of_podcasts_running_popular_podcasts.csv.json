        "description": "A lighthearted conversation by  runners about their lives as runners and the issues that are interesting or important to them and guests of the show.  TJM is meant to be a companion to you as you run.  Think of us as your running partners on days when you just need some friends to get you out on an easy run.  The show is composed of 10 segments, one for each mile, and every 10 minutes or so we move on to the next topic, to keep things interesting.  Among the hosts' experience are ten 100-mile finishes, dozens of half and full marathons, plenty of 50-milers, and some speedy 5ks and a BQ (and a handful of DNFs).\n\nYour host, Scotty Kummer is an attorney, doberman owner and quite possibly the most painstakingly average runner known to man.  Scott has stumbled through numerous plus 4 and 5 hour marathons.  He's DNF'ed the 150 mile, 100 mile, 50 mile and marathon distance.  Okay, and he is a member of the Order of the Hrimthurs for having completed the Arrowhead 135, the Tuscobia 160 and the Actif Epica 120K in the same calendar year (more people have walked on the moon) as well as finshed 50+ ultramarathons including several 100 mile races.  He was once kicked out of an ultra runing group due to allegations of cyber-bullying.  He has a habit of offending people by accident while trying to help them.  He is a co-founder of the Flatlander Ultrarunners in Chicagoland which has rapidly grown to over 2000 members.  He came up with the idea for Ten Junk Miles after becoming frustrated with hearing interview after interview of Scott Jurek and deciding that runners needed more: more discussions of bathroom breaks that went wrong, pacer stories from hell, DNF reports, stories of getting lost on the trail and other related matters.\n\nMore at http://www.tenjunkmiles.com",

But it's also egalitarian. Seldom will you find the elites separated from the regular folk. Everyone gets lost at some point. Everyone falls. These are our badges of passage.

Denn: \"Beim Laufen gibt es nur Gewinner.\"\nDafür berichten sie aus ihre eigenen Lauf-Erfahrungen, greifen auf ihr Wissen als angehende Ausdauer-Coaches zurück und holen sich den ein oder anderen Experten vors Mikro.\nSo wie die beiden selbst, ist auch der runskills-Podcast: ehrlich, authentisch, ungestellt, echt, undogmatisch und vom Herzen kommend. \n\"We run for chocolate\".

We nodigen spraakmakende gasten uit met inspirerende verhalen en pakken de actualiteit en de topsport mee. Terugkerend thema is de voorbereiding van Pim op de Marathon van Rotterdam volgend jaar, waar hij onder de 2 uur en 45 minuten wil lopen.\n\nVerwacht deskundige kroegpraat over momenten die voor iedere loper op elk niveau herkenbaar zijn. Van de intervaltraining die lekker ging of juist voor geen meter, het herstelloopje met veel te zware bovenbenen in de regen, de duurloop op vakantie, een heerlijke trailrun, tot het trainingswedstrijdje op de baan om de vorm te testen. We geven samen met onze gasten tips & tricks om het loopplezier te verhogen.\n\nWie de makers zijn?\nPim Bijl (26), sportjournalist van het AD en in die rol ook atletiekverslaggever op de grote toernooien. En Eric Brommert (51), een wandelende hardloopencyclopedie, hardloopondernemer en al jaren ‘race-regisseur’ van de Marathon Rotterdam, de man op de motor naast de kopgroep. Zij geven de hardlopende luisteraar, beginnend of al fanatiek, in deze podcast advies. Want hardlopen lijkt zo eenvoudig, maar blijkt vaak razend complex.",
